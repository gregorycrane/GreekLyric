Lyric Poems

  <CT begin>Plutarch Greek Questions: `Who is the hero Eunostus at
Tanagra, and what is the origin of the custom which forbids
women to set foot in his sacred grove?' -- Elieus, the son of
Cephisus and Scias, had a son Eunostus, who is said to have
taken his name from a nymph Eunosta who brought him up.
Though an honourable character was combined in him with
good looks, he was an austere man, and the story goes that
when one of his cousins the daughters of Colonus, a maiden<end eng>
<PN>5

<beg eng>named Ochna, fell in love with him and tried to win him, he
rejected her suit with contumely and went off to lodge a
complaint with her brothers. But she was before him, and
made the like accusation of him, urging her brothers Echemus,
Leon, and Bucolus to slay him for having forced her. Whereupon
they set an ambush and slew the poor boy, and shortly
after were taken prisoners for it by Elieus. Repenting her
crime and torn between a lover's remorse and a sister's pity,
Ochna now told Elieus the whole truth, and Elieus taking it
to Colonus, Colonus gave his judgment, and the brothers fled
the country and their sister threw herself down a precipice.
Such is the account given by the poetess Myrtis of Anthedon.
Thus came the shrine and grove of Eunostus to be forbidden
ground to women, and indeed it often happened, in time of
earthquake, famine, or other portent, that the citizens of
Tanagra made careful enquiry whether a woman had not
inadvertently approached the spot.<end eng><CT end>

<TT><beg eng>CORINNA

Life

  Suidas Lexicon: Corinna: -- Daughter of Acheloîdorus
and Hippocrateia, of Thebes or of Tanagra;
pupil of Myrtis; [nioknamed Myia `Fly';] a lyric
poetess. It is said that she was victorious five times
over Pindar. She wrote five Books, and Inscriptions,
and Lyric Nomes.

  Plutarch Glory of Athens: When Pindar was as
yet young, and prided himself overmuch on his
command of language, Corinna censured his ill-taste
because, though myths are the proper work of a
poet, and forms of words, turns of phrase, changes
of expression, tunes and rhythms mere embellishments,
his poems were nevertheless devoid of them.
Pindar took strong objection to her words and proceeded
to compose the lyric which begins: `Ismenus,
or gold-distaffed Melia, or Cadmus, or the holy race
of the Sown, or the doughty might of Heracles, or
the cheerful worship of Dionysus ...'<fn 1> and showed
it Corinna. Whereupon she retorted, laughing, that
he should sow with the hand and not with the whole
sack. For Pindar had simply made mixed drinks of
his myths and then poured them into his song.

  <beg eng>Scholiast on Aristophanes Acharnians:<end eng> A)gora/zein#10 <beg eng>-- to
behave in the market-place with arrogance of
manner and licence of speech; an Attic use of the
word, for using which in Book I of his Maiden-Songs
Corinna takes Pindar to task.

  Aelian Historical Miscellanies: When the poet
Pindar competed at Thebes he happened on ignorant
judges, and was defeated five times by Corinna. By
way of exposing their lack of good taste, he called
Corinna a sow.<fn 1>

  Pausanias Description of Greece: Corinna, the only
poet of Tanagra, is commemorated by a monument
in the open street and by a painting in the gymnasium.
The latter represents her in the act of
putting on the headband she won when she defeated
Pindar in the lyric competition at Thebes. In my
opinion her victory may be set down first to her
dialect, because she did not sing like Pindar in
Doric, but in a dialect which Aeolians would understand,
and secondly because, if one may really judge
from the portrait, she was at that time a remarkably
good-looking woman.<fn 2>

  Introduction to Pindar: The names of the aforesaid
lyric poets are these: -- Alcman, Alcaeus, Sappho,
Stesichorus, Ibycus, Anacreon, Simonides, Bacchylides
and Pindar; [some authorities add to these
Corinna].<fn 3>

fair though it be, that hath taken me captive ...

she pits her own poetry against old Corinna's, and

herself.

their wrath would be appeased `if maidens two' consented
to be sacrificed to `deities twain.'<fn 3> The oracle found no
maiden of the city willing to obey it, till a bondwoman
brought word of it away to the daughters of Orion. No
sooner had she told them as they stood at the loom, than they
accepted death for their neighbours' sake rather than death
by the plague, and crying thrice to the Gods below that they
were a willing sacrifice, smote themselves with the shuttle
beneath the chin, severed the vein of the throat, and fell
both of them dead. In pity of them Persephonä and Hades
made the maidens' bodies to disappear, and raised up from
out of the earth in the stead of them two stars, which
appeared and rose into the sky, and men called them comets.
And at Orchomenus in Boeotia all the Aonians built a shrine
in remembrance of the maidens, whither every year boys and

  Plutarch Music [on the Mixolydian mode]: In the
History of Harmonics Aristoxenus declares it to have
been invented by Pythocleides the flute-player. Lysis
states that Lamprocles of Athens, realising that this
mode has the `disjunction' (or interval of a full tone

the octachord EFGABCDE) not where it had been
almost universally thought to have it but at its treble

Lives

  Plutarch Music: Among those of his own age
Aristoxenus declares that it fell to the lot of Telesias
of Thebes to be educated in his youth in the best
music, and to learn the works of famous artists,
particularly of Pindar, Dionysius of Thebes, Lamprus,
Pratinas, and the rest, in fact all of the lyric poets
who were good composers of music.<fn 1>

  Plato Menexenus [Socrates and Menexenus]:
Men. Whom do you mean? surely Aspasia, don't
you? -- Soc. Yes, I do, and Connus son of Metrobius.
These are my two teachers, Aspasia of rhetoric and
Connus of music. No wonder that a man can speak
with such an education. Yet even a man who was
not so well educated, but who owed his music to
Lamprus and his rhetoric to Antiphon of Rhamnus,
would be able to win himself fame by eulogising
Athenians at Athens.

  Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: Another water-drinker
was Lamprus the musician, of whom Phrynichus
says that `the sea-mews among whom Lamprus
died sing his dirge,<fn 2> the water-drinker, the whining

  <beg eng>The Same: Sophocles had not only been a handsome
youth but had been taught dancing and music
in his childhood by Lamprus.

  Suidas Lexicon: Pratinas: -- Son of Pyrrhonides,
or according to some authorities, of Encomius, of
Phlius, a tragic poet. He competed against Aeschylus
and Choerilus in the 70th Olympiad (B.C. 500-497)
and was the first writer of Satyric drama. It
was during the performance of one of his plays that
the wooden platforms on which the audience stood
gave way, and thereafter the Athenians built themselves
a theatre. He exhibited fifty dramas in all,
thirty-two of which were Satyric. He was victorious
once.

  Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner [on dancing]: It is
said that the old poets Thespis, Pratinas, Phrynichus
were called dancers because they not only made
their plays a matter of choric dancing but actually
taught dancing generally, apart from their own
dramas.

  Introduction to Aeschylus Seven against Thebes:
The play was produced in the archonship of Theagenides
in the 78th Olympiad (B.C. 468). Aeschylus won
with the Laius, the Oedipus, the Seven Against Thebes,
and the satyr-play Sphinx. The second prize fell to
Aristias with the Perseus, the Tantalus, the Antaeus,
and a satyr-play of his father Pratinas, the Wrestlers.

Life

  Aristophanes Frogs: Xanthias to Dionysus: Here
we are, sir; the initiates he told us of are at their
games hereabouts. They're singing the Iacchus
which they sing through the market-place.<fn 1>

  Scholiast on the passage: Diagoras was an atheist
lyric poet who like Socrates introduced new
deities. According to Aristarchus, Aristophanes
does not introduce Diagoras here singing of the
Gods, but uses the word `singing' ironically for
`jeering at,' `putting to scorn.' So the poet is
inciting the Athenians, who accordingly condemned
Diagoras on the charge of blasphemy, and offered
the reward of a talent to any who should put him to
death, and two talents to any who should take him
alive, calling upon the Pellanians to do one or the
other. Compare Craterus in his Collection of the
Decrees. This Diagoras was a Melian, the son of
Teleclytus, and belongs to the time of Simonides
and Pindar. According to other commentators,
among them Apollodorus of Tarsus, the reading is<end eng>

dead tyrants, a talent; and we want to do the same
here. Whoever shall kill Philocrates the Struthian
shall receive a talent, and whoever shall bring him
alive, four talents, etc.

  Scholiast on the passage: Diagoras of Melos: This
man after the capture of Melos came to live at
Athens, and disparaged the Mysteries, with the
result that many of the citizens were unwilling to
be initiated. Accordingly the Athenians, as we are
told by Melanthius in his tract On the Mysteries,
made this proclamation against him and inscribed it
on a bronze tablet.

  Aristophanes Clouds: Strepsiades and Pheidippides:
S. Vortex is king; he has turned out Zeus.
-- P. Bah! what nonsense! -- S. You may take it it's
true. -- P. Who says so? -- S. Socrates of Melos.

  Scholiasts on the passage: Of Melos: -- Not literally,
for Socrates was and Athenian. But because Diagoras,
who was a Melian, was attacked for opposing the
Gods, and Socrates is now attacked by the poet for
atheism, Aristophanes calls Socrates a Melian. (2)
Diagoras of Melos, who after a friend had betrayed
his trust, turned atheist, which so enraged the
Athenians that they maltreated Melos. (3) Diagoras
was a blasphemer, of Melos (cf. 3 below). According
to another account Diagoras was a teacher of
Socrates,<end eng>
<PN>61

  <beg eng>Hesychius of Miletus On Famous Men: Diagoras
son of Telecleides, when a slave, was observed by
Democritus of Abdera to be a promising fellow, and,
bought by him for ten thousand drachmas,<fn 1> became his
pupil. He devoted himself to lyric poetry. He
was nicknamed the Atheist because, when a fellow-poet,
whom he accused of taking a Paean he had
written, swore that he had not stolen it and then
won distinction by having it performed as his own,
he wrote in his vexation the prose-work known as
The Tower of Defence to mark his repudiation of his
religious beliefs.

  Suidas Lexicon: Diagoras. -- Son of Telecleides or
of Teleclytus, of Melos, philosopher and writer of
songs ...; he comes in point of time after Pindar
and Bacchylides but before Melanippides, and
flourished therefore in the 78th Olympiad (B.C.
468-465).<fn 2>

  Diodorus of Sicily Historical Library: While these
events were taking place,<fn 3> Diagoras nicknamed the
Atheist fled from Attica under a false accusation of
impiety and in fear of his life, and the Athenian
people put the price of a talent of silver<fn 4> on his
head.

  [Lysias] Against Andocides: The impiety of the
defendant is so far greater than that of Diagoras of
Melos, in that Diagoras' offence was once of words,
and was committed in respect of foreign rites and
festivals, whereas the defendant's is of deeds, and
committed in respect of the rites and festivals of his
native city.

  <beg eng>Cicero On the Nature of the Gods: But it sometimes
will happen that good men make a good end.
Such examples we take up eagerly and attribute
them quite irrationally to the immortal Gods. Yet
when at Samothrace<fn 1> a friend once asked Diagoras
the Atheist if a man like him, who believed that
the Gods took no thought for the affairs of man, did
not observe what numbers, to judge by the multitude
of paintings dedicated, had escaped by their
vows the violence of the weather and come safe to
harbour, he replied, `The reason of it is that there
are no paintings to record the poor fellows who
made shipwreck and were drowned.'<fn 2> In a storm
at sea the same philosopher, in answer to his
frightened fellow-passengers who were saying that
it served them right for allowing him to travel
aboard the same ship, pointed to the numerous
other vessels labouring on the same course, and
asked them whether they thought that Diagoras
was aboard those as well as this. So true is it that
what we are or how we behave ourselves has nothing
to do with the colour of our fortune.

  Tatian Against the Greeks: Diagoras was an
Athenian, but when he made mock of the Mysteries
at Athens you punished him, and when his Phrygian
Discourses came into your hands you forthwith
hated us.

  Aelian Historical Miscellanies: I understand that
Mantinea was remarkable for the excellence of its

<beg eng>of certain of his laws by his countrymen in after

most famous citizen of Mantinea, when with advancing
years he left the ring and became his city's
lawgiver, thus serving his country in far nobler
fashion than by being proclaimed victor in the
arena. His fellow-lawgiver is said to have been
Diagoras of Melos, whose favourite he was. More
might be said here of Nicodorus, but I refrain lest
I should seem to plagiarise the encomium<fn 1> of
Diagoras, an abandoned wretch of whom I have no

Life

  Strabo Geography: Ceos had originally four cities,
but now has two, IÅlis and Carthaea, with which
the others were combined, Poieâssa with Carthaea
and Coresia with IÅlis. IÅlis was the birthplace
of the lyric poet Simonides and of his nephew
Bacchylides,<fn 1> and later of the physician Erasistratus
and the Peripatetic philosopher Ariston. There
appears to have been a law here, mentioned by
Menander in the lines `The Cean custom takes my
fancy still, #5 The man who can't live well shall
not live ill,' whereby in order to make the supplies
go round, all citizens who reached the age of sixty
should drink the hemlock.<fn 2>

  Plutarch Exile: The ancients, too, it seems, wrote
the finest and most famous of their works with the
aid of Exile. Thucydides the Athenian composed
his history of the war between the Peloponnese
and Athens near Scaptä Hylä in Thrace, Xenophon
wrote at Scyllus in Elis ..., the poet Bacchylides
in the Peloponnese.

Flourished Bacchylides and Diagoras the atheist.<fn 3>

father of Bacchylides, and it is derived from<end eng> meidiw=
<beg eng>`to smile' as Pheidylus from<end eng> feidw/ <beg eng>`thrift.'

  Scholiast on Pindar [`skilled is the man who
knoweth much by nature; they that have but
learnt -- even as a pair of crows, gluttonous in their
wordiness, these chatter vain things against the
divine bird of Zeus']: (a) This is directed against
Bacchylides, who had in a way become a competitor
in the same arena. (b) He is hinting at Bacchylides
and Simonides, calling himself an eagle and
his rivals crows.
  The Same [`the eagle is swift among winged
things, and though he chase it from afar he quickly
taketh his quarry all bloody in his claws; but the
chattering daws have a lower pasturage']: That is,
my rivals in art resemble jackdaws, only shrieking
and feeding at lower levels, and cannot rise to
the heights. He appears to be directing this at
Bacchylides, with whom he had a feud, and compares
himself to an eagle and Bacchylides to a jackdaw.

  The Same [`but I must shun the overmuch biting
of slander']: He is hinting at Bacchylides, who was
always traducing him to Hiero.

  The Same [`"Pretty," say the children to an
ape, "pretty thing," but Rhadamanthus, etc.']:
(a) According to some authorities this is directed
against Bacchylides, who was in high repute with
Hiero. ... (b) It may be intended thus: Bacchylides
appears in the eyes of children a man of skill, but
not in the eyes of grown men.<end eng>
<PN>85

  <beg eng>The Same [`longing for more than they can get,<fn 1>
they do wound their own selves instead of obtaining
their heart's desire']: The reference again is to
Bacchylides. This is taken to be the meaning owing
to Bacchylides' poems being preferred by Hiero.

  [Longinus] On the Sublime: Again, take lyric
verse; would you sooner be Bacchylides than
Pindar? or take tragedy; would you sooner be
Ion of Chios than the great Sophocles? Bacchylides
and Ion may be faultless, may have attained
to complete mastery of the polished style, whereas
there are times when Pindar and Sophocles carry
all before them like a conflagration, though they
often flicker down quite unaccountably and come
to an unhappy fall. Yet surely no man in his
senses would rate all the plays of Ion put together
at so high a figure as the Oedipus.

  Ammonius Words alike but different: The Nereãds
are not the same as the Daughters of Nereus.
Compare Didymus in his Commentary on the Victory-Songs
of Bacchylides, where he says in an explanation:
`Some authorities declare that the Nereãds
are not the same as the Daughters of Nereus, the
latter being his true daughters by Doris and the
former receiving the more general name of Nereãds
because they came of other mothers.'<fn 2>

  Porphyrio on an Ode of Horace [Pastor cum
traheret]: In this ode he imitates Bacchylides, who
makes Cassandra foretell the future events of the
Trojan War as Horace here makes Nereus.<fn 3>

<beg fn>
<fn 1>lit. `for excessive measure'
<fn 2>Didymus apparently
disagreed, but in any case this may be taken as evidence
that in 12 he read Daughters of Nereus at 1. 102 and Nereãds
at 1.38, though the latter is probably not what Bacchylides
wrote and 12 is a dithyramb

<CT begin>Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner [on drinking-cups]: Later
they were made of earthenware and silver on the pattern of

famous, were the Boeotian cups as they are called, having
been first used by Heracles on his warlike expeditions; hence
their alternative name with some people, Heracleotic, though
indeed these differ from the others in having on their handles
what is known as the chain of Heracles. The Boeotian type
is mentioned by Bacchylides where he addresses the Dioscuri,
summoning them to a holy feast:<fn 3><CT end>

  No carcase of beef is here, nor gold, nor purple

<beg eng>marvelled at the exceeding courage of the man; and
the heart of the Sun-God's daughter's spouse<fn 1> grew
wroth, and a strange new plot he wove, and said
`Give ear, mighty Father of mine! If indeed I am
thy child of Phoenix' white-armed daughter, I
prithee send now forth of heaven a swift fire-tressed
levin-bolt for a sign all may know; and thou, if for
thy part thou comest of Troezenian Aethra by
Earth-Shaker Poseidon, go fling thyself without
demur into thy father's house and fetch this bright
golden ornament of my hand.<fn 2> So shalt thou know
if the Son of Cronus that is lord of the thunder and
ruleth all, heareth the prayer I make him.'

  Heard the prayer was and approved by mighty Zeus,
and, willing to do his dear son an honour plain to all,
he made him a surpassing sign and lightened. And
when he saw the welcome portent, the war-stedfast
hero stretched his arms to the loud sky, and `Here,
Theseus,' quoth he, `seest thou plain the gifts Zeus
giveth unto me; come then thou, and spring into
the roaring main, and thy father Lord Poseidon son

son of Zeus was amazed within him, and he bade
them keep the cunningly-wrought ship before the
wind. But Destiny struck out another path.

  The bark sped on amain, urged from astern by the

  <CT begin>The first part of this Ode seems to have contained an invocation

Dexithea]: Euxantius told them the marvel that once befel
him: -- `Surely I fear war with Zeus and the loud-thundering
Earth-Shaker. Surely their levin-bolt and trident sent a
land and its people every man into deep Tartarus, all but my
mother and her well-walled house' -- (b) Callimachus Origins:
And therewithal insolence and a lightning-death, and likewise
the wizards the Telchins and Demonax who so foolishly
flouted the blessed Gods -- these the old man<fn 3> did put in his
writing-tablets, and aged Macelo mother of Dexithea, them
twain that alone the Immortals left unharmed when they
overturned an island for its sinful insolence. (c) Scholiast on
the Ibis: It is said that Macelo and her sisters were
daughters of Damon, and that Jupiter having enjoyed their
hospitality saved them<fn 4> when he struck the Telchins, of
whom Damon was chief, by lightning for maliciously blighting
all the fruits of the earth. To these daughters came
Minos, and was united with Dexione, and begat Euxantius
father of the Euxantidae. Compare also (d) Nonnus Dionysiaca:
Macello entertained Zeus and Apollo at one [board]; and (e)
Tzetzes Theogony: From the blood which dripped from the
mutilated Uranus and entered the earth sprang first the
three Furies Tisiphone, Megaera, and Alecto, and with

on what is his own, then vies he with the first.
Disease and helpless poverty apart, every human life

he of all mankind had sent up the greatest gifts to
hallowed Pytho.

  Yet of all the dwellers that are in Greece,<fn 2>
O illustrious Hiero, no man can say that any hath

eke hath share in the gifts of the violet-tressäd
Muses, -- one who, though his hand was terrible once
in war, looketh calmly now that he is old on a
happiness that is from day to day, well knowing it

by Apollo of the golden bow. Aye, when he had
come to that unlooked-for day, he would not await
so woeful a lot as servitude, but had them build a
pyre before his brazen-walled court and went up
upon it with his trusty wife and his fair-tressed
daughters wailing incessantly; and raised his hands
towards high heaven and cried `Almighty Spirit,<fn 1>
where is the gratitude of the Gods? where is the
Lord that Leto bare? Fallen is the palace of
Alyattes,<fn 2> [and I have no requital of the] thousand
[gifts I gave;<fn 3> rather is the ancient] city [of Lydus

houses. What was hateful once is welcome
now; sweetest it is to die.'

men kindle the wooden pile. Whereat the maidens
shrieked and threw up their hands to their mother;

`Ho for a thrice-blessäd man who possesseth of Zeus

  Happy the man whom God hath made share in
honours and hath given with that enviable lot life-long
riches too. For no man on earth is fortunate
in all things; witness the tale of that gate-breaker
invincible,<fn 2> that child of sheen-levined Zeus who
went down to the house of slender-ankled Persephonä,
for to fetch up to the light from Hades the
jag-toothäd hound<fn 3> that was son of Echidna the
unapproachable. There was he aware of the spirits of
hapless mortals, there beside the streams of Cocytus
like leaves a-quiver in the wind on the gleaming
shoulders of Ida where the sheep go grazing, and

<end fn>
<PN>151

<beg eng>among them outstanding the shade of that staunch
wielder of spears, Porthaon's son.<fn 1>

  And when the wondrous hero-child of Alemena
beheld him in his shining armour, first drew he the
shrill-twanging string to his bow's end, and then,
opening the lid of his quiver, picked out a bronze-headed
arrow. But the ghost of Meleager appeared
now close before him and spake as one that knew
him well, saying, `Son of great Zeus, stay thou
there and calm thy heart, and launch not vainly
from thy hands a brute arrow against a dead man's
ghost. There's naught to fear.'<fn 2> The princely son
of Amphitryon marvelled at his words and said,
`What God or man reared such a scion as this, and
where? and who slew him? Sure the fair-girdled
Hera will soon send the slayer of such as one
against me also -- albeit flaxen-haired Pallas, methinks,
will look to that.'

and she sped a wide-mighted boar, shameless
in battle, into the lawns of Calydon, where on the
flood of his strength he went goring the vine-rows
and slaying the sheep together with every man that
came athwart his way. With a right good will and
for six days together did we that were the flower
of the Greeks maintain a loathsome warfare against
him, and when God gave us Aetolians the mastery,
we buried those that were slain by the violent
onset of the squealing boar, Ancaeus to wit and
AgelaÅs the dearest of my trusty brethren whom
Althaea bare in the far-famed palace of my father
Oeneus; aye, and with them did a dire fate destroy
yet others; for Leto's wily<fn 1> huntress-daughter stayed
not her wrath, and with a right good will fought we
the stubborn Curetes for the tawny hide. And I
slew in that fight, among many more, Iphiclus and
noble Aphares the swift brethren of my mother;

<end fn>
<PN>155

<beg eng>for hardy-hearted Ares distinguisheth not a friend
in war, and the javelins go and come blindly from
the hand 'gainst the lives of the foemen, and bring
death to whom God will.

  With no thought of this, my ill-starred mother,<fn 1>
the wily daughter of Thestius, plotted, fearless
woman, my destruction, and turned key and took
from the carven chest the swiftly-dooming log which
Fate had ordained long before to be the bourne of
my life.<fn 2> It so fell out that I had overtaken before
the walls of their ancient well-built city of Pleuron,
whither they fled, the faultless figure of a man, to
wit Daãpylus' valiant son Clymenus, and was in act
to slay, when sweet life went faint within me and
I felt strength fail -- ah me! -- and with my last
breath wept my woe for the glorious youth that I
must leave behind me.'

  'Tis said that then for the only time was the
eyelid of Amphitryon's son, that never feared warcry,
wetted with a tear, because he pitied the fate
of that suffering wight; and he answered him,
`Best were it for mortals never to be born nor ever

cometh of these laments, one should speak of that
he is like to accomplish. Is there, I ask thee, in
the palace of warrior Oeneus an unwedded daughter
like in beauty unto thee? I would fain make such
an one my splendid bride.' Whereat the ghost of
the stedfast warrior Meleager answered him:
`Deãaneira left I at my home with the green of youth
upon her sweet neck, unwitting still of the golden
enchantress Cypris.'<fn 1>

  O white-armed Calliopä, stay thou here thy well-wrought
chariot, and sing now of Zeus Son of Cronus,
Olympian captain of the Gods, and of Alpheus'
never-wearying flood, of the might of Pelops,<fn 2> and

won the race he hath come back from unto em-battled
Syracuse with a leaf of happiness for Hiero.<fn 3>
Now we should thrust envy aside with both hands,

On this wise spake a man of Boeotia, Hesiod, servitor

Whereat in wrath she cast into their breasts a

Life

  Suidas Lexicon: Melanippides: -- (1) Son of Criton;
flourished in the 65th Olympiad (520-517 B.C.); of
Melos; he wrote many books of Dithyrambs as well as
Epic Poems, Inscriptions, Elegies, etc., etc. (2) Grandson
of the elder of this name, also son of Criton,
and, like his grandfather, a lyric poet; he made great
innovations in the Dithyramb, and spent part of his
time at the court of King Perdiccas,<fn 1> where he
eventually died. He too wrote Lyric Poems and
Dithyrambs.<fn 2>

  Parian Chronicle: From the time when Melanippides
of Melos was victorious at Athens 231 years,
in the archonship of Pythocritus (494 B.C.).

  Xenophon Recollections of Socrates: When he discovered
that Aristodemus neither sacrificed to the
Gods nor had recourse to divination but laughed
to scorn those who did, he said to him, `Tell me,
Aristodemus; are there any men whose artistic skill
you admire?' `Yes,' he replied. `Tell us their
names,' said Socrates. `For the epic I most admire
Homer,' he answered, `for the Dithyramb Melanippides,
for tragedy Sophocles, for sculpture Polycleitus,
for painting Zeuxis.' `Which now,' asked Socrates,
`do you consider the more admirable artists, those

<end fn>
<PN>233

<beg eng>who make images which are without mind or motion,
or those who make living creatures capable of
thought and action?'

  Aristotle Rhetoric: In like manner, a long sentence
becomes a discourse in itself, like the purely instrumental
parts of a song when they are too long.
Hence the satire of Democritus of Chios upon
Melanippides for making an instrumental interlude<fn 1>
take the place of the antistrophe:

  He that does any ill to another does ill to himself,
but of all ills the worst to the doer is the long
interlude.<fn 2>

The same stricture might well be made upon the
users of long clauses.

  Plutarch That a Life lived according to Epicurus is
not worth living: For Hiero, surely, or Attalus, or
ArchelaÅs could never have been brought to oust
from their festive table Euripides, Simonides,
Melanippides, or such men as Crates or Diodotus, in
favour of buffoons like Cardax, Agrias, or Callias, and
jazz-bandsmen like Thrasonides or Thrasyleon.

  <CT begin>Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner [on dates]: Melanippides of
Melos, in the Danaãds, calls the fruit of the palm dates, where
he describes those maidens thus:<CT end>

  For they wore not the shapely form of men, nor
yet had they the voice of women, but did strenuously
in seated chariots all about the sunny<fn 1> woodlands,
ofttimes rejoicing their heart in the chase, ofttimes
seeking the frankincense' holy tear and the sweetscented
date or the smooth Syrian grains of the
cassia.

<N>2 Marsyas

  <CT begin>The Same: On the subject of flutes one of the guests
observed that Melanippides in his Marsyas had rightly disparaged
flute-playing in speaking of Athena thus:<CT end>

He was the only man, not excluding kings, who ever entered
at Olympia as many as seven. And his winning not only
first place but second and fourth according to Thucydides -- second
and third according to Euripides -- is the highest and
most honourable distinction ever won in this field. Euripides'
Ode contains the following passage:<CT end>

  But I will sing thy praises,<fn 2> son of Cleinias. A
noble thing is victory, noblest of the noble to do
what no Greek had ever done, be first and second

  Plato Gorgias: Socrates and Callicles: -- S.
First let us consider flute-playing. Do you not
think, Callicles, that its sole object is our pleasure?
-- C. Yes. -- S. And isn't this true of all such arts,
for instance of competitive lyre-playing? -- C. It is.
S. And how about the training of choruses and the
composition of dithyrambs? Is it not the same with
them? Do you suppose that Cinesias son of Meles
concerns himself to say something that shall be
improving to hear, or something that shall make
him popular? -- C. Obviously the latter, Socrates, is
the object of Cinesias. -- S. And what of his father
Meles? Was his singing to the lyre inspired by the
highest motive? Whatever may be said of the son,
is it not true that the father's ideal was not even
the greatest possible pleasure to his audience? At
any rate his singing annoyed them.<fn 3> Be that as it
may, do you not agree that both arts, singing to
the lyre and the composition of dithyrambs, were

  Scholiasts on the passage: (1379) According to
Didymus, he says `circle' because Cinesias is a
composer of circular poems [poems for the circular
choruses?], and `splay-foot' because he is lame ...
But Aristotle in the Dramatic Catalogues tells us
that there were two poets of the name; according
to Symmachus, Euphronius says it is because
Cinesias was splay-footed [or bow-legged]. -- (1383)
... He is making fun of the poems of the dithyramb-writers;
for it was their custom to use such epithets.
He is also ridiculing their `lightness' [or, as we
should say, shallowness]. -- (1393) ... Much of
their style is like this, but the sense exiguous;
compare the proverb, `You have less sense even
than a dithyramb.' -- (1395) ... He is satirising
the dithyramb-writers.

  Scholiast Aristophanes Lysistrata [a lively scene
too long to print here, in which Cinesias with his
baby implores his wife to leave the Acropolis which
has been seized by the women, and come home]:
He caricatures Cinesias as an uxorious husband. He

  Scholiast on the passage (161): Cinesias was a
dithyramb-writer, who composed a `pyrrhich' dance
... Cinesias attacked the comedy-writers on the
ground that they had nothing to say. He was a
nervous, timid man, and wasted to a skeleton ...<fn 2>

  Scholiast on the passage: Cinesias was a thin man,
and Cleocritus a profligate. He means, if you were
to fasten Cinesias instead of wings to Cleocritus so
that they rose in the air, the result would be that
they would be carried away for good by the wind.--He
is caricatured as being excessively thin and as
a foreigner and a today. Cleocritus is mentioned

the poets' plays had come to be staged on the
cheap. Anyhow Aristotle says that it was in the
archonship of this Callias (406 B.C., the date of the
play), that it was decreed that tragedies and
comedies should be produced together at the Dionysia;
so that perhaps there was a like combination for the
Lenaea; and not long afterwards Cinesias finally
abolished the system of the staging of plays as a
State-service [for wealthy citizens]; whence Strattis
in the play he wrote upon him speaks of `the shop<fn 1>

  Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner [on thin people]:
Aristophanes too in the Gerytades gives the following
list of thin men sent as ambassadors by the
poets above ground to the poets in the nether
regions:--``A. `Who is 't that dares descend to th'
hold of Death and pass the gates of Darkness?'--B.
Well, we've had a general meeting of the
Assembly, and picked as delegates from each art
gentlemen we knew to be fond of paying visits
underground.--A. Why, have you regular visitors
to Hades with you?--B. I should just think we
have.--A. Like regular visitors to Thrace?-- B.
You've got it.--A. And who may they be, pray?--B.
First there's Sannyrion from the comedy-men,
next Meletus from the tragic choruses, and Cinesias
from the circular.'' And then he proceeds thus:

<beg fn>
<fn 1>B.C. 394; Aristophanes' Ecclesiazusae which mentions C.
at line 330 was performed in 392 or 389, his Frogs (above) in 405
<fn 2>as no such brother of D. is recorded, Philoxenus
is prob. the poet (see p. 370)<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>263

<beg eng>``What very thin hopes you seem to have built
on!<fn 1> If many such get together they'll be carried
away in the flood of their own scouring.''<fn 2>

  ... Now Cinesias was in fact very thin and very
tall, and Strattis has an entire play written on him,
in which he calls him Achilles of Phthia because he
was always using the vocative of the word Phthian
in his poetry. Thus he made fun of his appearance
by addressing him as, `O Phthian Achilles.'<fn 3>
Other writers, including Aristophanes, have frequently
called Cinesias `the lime-wood man' because
he wore stays of lime-wood to support his length
and thinness. We know that he was of a sickly
habit and altogether a strange being from what the
orator Lysias tells us in the speech called The
Oration in behalf of Phanias against an Unconstitutional
Measure, where he makes out that he abandoned
his art for the profession of informer and became
a rich man. And there is no doubt that this is the
poet, because he is represented to have been caricatured
for his atheism and he is shown to have
been of that character in the speech. The words
of the orator are these: `I am surprised that you
do not take it amiss that the upholder of the law
in this case should be a man like Cinesias, whom
you all know to have passed all limits in his defiance
of law whether human or divine. Is not this the
man who commits such an outrage upon religion
that the world in general cannot even mention it
with propriety and the comic poets tell you of it
regularly every year? Is not this the man who, with

member of the club has been so visited by Heaven
that his enemies do not wish him dead but hope
that he may live long as an example, so that others
may realise that irreligion is punished not in the
children but in the fathers, for that these are
visited with greater and severer calamities both
in body and estate than all the rest of mankind
put together. To be sick or to die of ordinary
ills is the common lot of man, but to continue
thus year in year out, to be dying day by day
and yet be unable to make an end, is a fate
deserved only by the committers of such sins as
the defendant's.' Such is the orator's description
of Cinesias.

play the lyre at Athens<fn 4> and to have won the prize for it at
the Panathenaic Festival in the archonship of Callias.<fn 5> He
was a pupil of Aristocleides, a great singer to the lyre, who
was descended from Terpander and flourished in Greece
during the Persian Wars. Phrynis was a singer to the flute
before he taught him the lyre. Istros tells us, in the work
entitled The Lyric Poets, that Phrynis was a Lesbian, the son
of Camon, and that he was originally one of Hiero's cooks,
but was given with other slaves to Aristocleides. But this
seems to be an invention; for if he had been a slave and a
cook of Hiero's, the fact would not have been concealed by
the comic poets, who often speak of him in connexion with
the innovations by which he caused the deterioration of singing.

Life

  Parian Chronicle: From the time when Telestes of
Selinus won at Athens 139 years, in the archonship
of Micon at Athens (402 B.C.).

  Diodorus of Sicily Historical Library: About this
year (398 B.C.) flourished the most famous dithyramb-writers,
Philoxenus of Cythera, Timotheus of Miletus,
Telestes of Selinus, and Polyãdus painter and
musician.

  Apollonius Marvels of History: The musician
Aristoxenus declares in his Life of Telestes that at
the time of his visit to Italy certain remarkable
things happened of which there was one which
concerned the women. It seems that they were
seized with a distraction which caused them when
seated sometimes at their supper to appear to answer
a call, and then rush incontinently through the door
and run out of the city. When the Locrians and
Rhegines asked the advice of the oracle on the
matter, the reply was that in order to free themselves
from this visitation they must sing Spring Paeans for
sixty days. Hence the large number of paean-writers
in Italy.

putting up to the poet Telestes, he arrived shortly
before the time to find the tyrant angry and determined
to bring him to book, but within a few days
had fulfilled his obligation with a despatch and a
skill equally admirable.

<TT>THE POEMS OF TELESTES

<N>1<fn 2> The Argo

  <CT begin>Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: To this another rejoined:
`But Telestes of Selinus takes up arms against Melanippides'
(fr. 2) in the Argo, where he says--he is speaking of Athena
(and the flute)--:<CT end>

  My mind believeth not that in the mountain
copses divine Athena took this instrument that was
as clever as herself and then, for fear of shame to
her face, cast it again from her hands to be the
glory of the applauding Marsyas, bestial son of a
nymph. For why should she feel prick of concern

<beg eng>for lovely beauty, she whom Clotho had assigned
virginity unwedded and unchilded?--

<CT begin>that is, she would not have minded spoiling her looks,
because of her virginity--and he continues:<CT end>

  Nay, vainly and not for the dance was this tale
of minstrel-babblers sped to Greece, to make a
reproach unto men a clever art--

<CT begin>(and then he praises flute-playing)<CT end>

--which the airy breath of the holy Goddess together
with the resplendent swiftness of her nimble-winge\d
hands hath given to Bromius to be best of
all his menials.

<N>2-3 Asclepius

  <CT begin>Athenaeus (continued): No less elegantly has Telestes
described the use of the flutes in this passage of the
Asclepius:<CT end>

  or the Phrygian king of holy fair-breath'd flutes,<fn 1>
who first tuned the Lydian strain in answer to the
Dorian Muse, and inwove the winge\d breeze of
his breath with the shifting-shape\d reed.

  <CT begin>Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner [on the stringed instrument
called magadis]: Telestes in his Dithyramb Hymenaeus tells
us in the following lines that it had five strings:<CT end>

  Then uttering various din they roused the horn-voiced<fn 2>
magadis, with five-lined jointure of strings
plying the to-and-fro footrace of swift hands.<fn 3>

<N>5

  <CT begin>Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: The Phrygian and Lydian
`modes,' which were of foreign origin, were made known to
the Greeks through the Phrygians and Lydians who emigrated
to the Peloponnese with Pelops ... Hence the
passage of Telestes of Selinus:<CT end>

  The first to sing the Phrygian tune of the Mountain
Mother amid flutes over the wine-bowls of
Greece were they that attended upon Pelops; and
the Greeks forthwith began to thrum the Lydian
hymn with shrill-voiced twanging of the lute.

  <CT begin>The Same [on the cup called phiale\]: And Theopompus
in his play Althaea says: `She took the brimming cup of
gold mid-bossed, but Telestes called it "boat"', Telestes
