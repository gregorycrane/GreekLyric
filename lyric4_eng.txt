  <beg eng>Satyrus Life of Euripides (from a 2nd-Cent.
Papyrus): When Timotheus was suffering from unpopularity
in Greece because of his musical innovations,
and in the depths of despair had actually made
up his mind to take his own life, it is said that
Euripides alone took the opposite line, and not only
laughed at the audiences, but realising how great an
exponent of his art Timotheus was, consoled him
with the most comforting arguments possible, and
went so far as to compose for him the prelude to
The Persians, his victory with which put an end to
Timotheus' unpopularity.

  Plutarch Should Old Men Govern? Thus when
Timotheus was being hissed as an innovator who
broke the laws of music, Euripides bade him be of
good cheer since he would soon have his audience
at his feet.

  The Same On Music: In like manner the lyric
poet Melanippides, in his turn, refused to leave the
art of music as he found it, and so also Philoxenus
and Timotheus. Down to the time of Aristocleides<fn 1>
the lyre had had seven strings. Timotheus divided
the Terpandrean `mode' into a greater number of
notes.<fn 2> Flute-playing too has become more complex
than it once was. In old days before the dithyramb-writer
Melanippides, it had become customary for
the flute-players to be paid by the poets, obviously
because the poetry had played the first part in the
performance and the flute-players had been merely

<fn 1>c. 480 B.C.
<fn 2>the reading is doubtful<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>285

<beg eng>assistants of the poets who trained the choruses.
But later on, this practice fell into disuse. Thus
Pherecrates<fn 1> the writer of comedy introduces Music
(as he calls her)<fn 2> in the shape of a woman who
shows every sign of having been badly used, and
makes Justice ask her the cause of her terrible
plight, whereupon Music (or, as we should call her,
Poetry)<fn 3> thus replies: `"I'll tell thee gladly, for
'tis equal joy to me to speak as 'tis for thee to hear."
My troubles all began with Melanippides; he was
the first to take and let me down and make me a
loose one with his twelve strings. Yet, to my thinking,
he treated me well enough, to what I suffer
now. Next, that accursed Athenian Cinesias has
done me so much damage by the extra-modal
"flourishes" he inserts between the strophes, that
the right rank of one of his dithyrambs looks like
the left. But all the same he was a good enough
fellow. As for Phrynis, he has bent me and twisted
me and utterly destroyed me in a particular whirl-wind
of his own, with his twelve modes on seven
strings. But all the same, he too was a good enough
fellow. If he did any damage, he made it right
again. But Timotheus now, he, my dear, has
debauched me and mauled me till I'm not fit to be
seen.--Justice. And who is this Timotheus?--Poetry.
A red-haired man from Miletus. He has
treated me worse than all the others by drawing

filled me as full of flourishes as a cabbage is of caterpillars<fn 2>
... And if he ever meets me walking
alone<fn 3> he strips me and undoes me<fn 4> with his
eleven strings.' Moreover Aristophanes the comic
poet mentions Philoxenus, and tells us that he introduced
(solo-)songs into the circular choruses. And
other writers of comedy have shown up the absurd
antics of the later composers who frittered music
away till there was nothing left of it.

  Plutarch Music [innovations in rhythm]: Innovations
are ascribed to Alcman and also to Stesichorus,
in both cases without departing from the beautiful
manner. But Crexus, Timotheus, Philoxenus, and
the other poets of their period were less refined and
more desirous of novelty, aiming at the popular
manner now<fn 5> known as the thematic or effect-producing.
For the employment of few strings<fn 6>
and the simplicity and grandeur of music have gone
entirely out of vogue.

  Plutarch Spartan Institutions: Disregard of the
musical tradition was not allowed. Even Terpander,
the oldest and in his time the greatest singer to the
lyre, and a celebrator of the deeds of the heroes, was

<fn 4>double meaning loosing the girdle and
dissolving into nothing
<fn 5>i.e. in the time of Aristoxenus
(fl. 336 B.C.), who is Plutarch's authority
<fn 6>this term is applied, more widely than its literal meaning would suggest,
to a general condition of technical unelaborateness<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>289

<beg eng>nevertheless fined by the Ephors, and his lyre nailed
to the wall, because, to suit his voice, he added to
it a single string more than was usual, and they, it
seems, approved only of the simpler style of music.
And when Timotheus was competing at the Carneian
Festival, one of the Ephors took a knife and asked
him from which end of the lyre he should cut off the
strings which brought the number beyond seven.

  Pausanias [on Sparta]: There is another way out
of the market-place, past the building called the
Scias or Shade, where the assembly is held to this
day ... Here the Spartans hung up the lyre of
Timotheus of Miletus after convicting him of adding
four new strings to the traditional seven when
singing to the lyre.<fn 1>

  Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: According to Artemon
in the 1st Book of his work on The Dionysiac
Monument,<fn 2> Timotheus of Miletus appears in most
accounts to have employed a magadis or lyre with an
unusually elaborate stringing, and when he was
called to account at Sparta for corrupting the musical
tradition, and it was proposed to cut off the superfluous
strings from his instrument, to have pointed out a
statuette of Apollo there which held a lyre of the
same number of strings as his, and so to have been
acquitted.

  Nicomachus Handbook of Harmony: The addition of
strings beyond the eighth was due not to reason but to
a desire to gratify the audience. Thus Theophrastus

<beg fn>
<fn 1>cf. Dio Chr. 33. 411, Cic. Leg. 2. 15. 39; the story is also
told of Phrynis to whom it more probably belongs, cf. p. 269
n. 4; the actual decree of the Ephors against T. is quoted
Boet. de Mus. 1, but is almost certainly a forgery of the 2nd Cent. B.C.

<end fn>
<PN>291

<beg eng>of Pieria added the ninth, Histiaeus of Colophon the
tenth, Timotheus of Miletus the eleventh, and so on
to the eighteenth.<fn 1>

  Clement of Alexandria Miscellanies: The first man
to set poems to music was Terpander of Antissa, who
thus dealt with the laws of Sparta;<fn 2> the Dithyramb
was invented by Lasus of Hermione\; the Hymn by
Stesichorus of Himera; the Choral dance by Alcman
of Sparta; Love-poems by Anacreon of Teos;
dancing the Hyporcheme by Pindar of Thebes; and
Nomes were first sung to dance and lyre by Timotheus
of Miletus.

  Plutarch Music: The Lyre-sung Nome was
established long before the Flute-sung, in the days
of Terpander ... Terpander composed Lyre-sung
Proems in epic verse, and it is clear that the ancient
Lyre-sung Nomes were of this nature from the
practice of Timotheus, who sang his first nomes in
hexameters with an intermixture of dithyrambic
phraseology, so that he might conceal at the outset
his sins against the musical tradition.

  Proclus Chrestomathy: The Nome is in honour of
Apollo and takes its name from his appellation
Nomius.<fn 3> The ancients used to make choruses and
sing the Nome to flute or lyre, but Chrysothemis the
Cretan first adopted a distinctive dress, and taking a
lyre in his hand to represent Apollo, sang a nome
solo, and as he became famous for this performance

<beg fn>
<fn 1>there follows a ref. to the passage of Pherecrates (p.
285): the seventh and the ninth are ascribed to T. by
[Censorin.] Gram. Lat. 6. 610, and the ninth by Pliny N.H. 7. 57
<fn 2>perh. a confusion between the two meanings of<end eng>
no/mos, <beg eng>`law' and `nome,' but cf. Plut. Sol. 3
<fn 3>the etymology is prob. incorrect<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>293

<beg eng>the competition has been of that type ever
since. Terpander appears to have been the first to
perfect the Nome by the employment of the heroic
metre, but no small contribution was made after him
by Arion of Methymna, who like him was both poet
and singer to the lyre. Innovations were also made
in it by Phrynis of Mytilene, who both combined the
hexameter with the `free' type of metre, and first
employed more strings than the traditional seven.
Timotheus afterwards brought it to its present condition.<fn 1>
The Dithyramb is full of movement and,
expressing a high degree of `possession' by means
of the dance, is directed to evoking the emotions
most characteristic of the God; wild, too, in its
rhythms, it nevertheless employs a simple phraseology.
The Nome, on the other hand, is sustained
in an orderly and dignified style by the characters it
describes; while its rhythms are easy and tranquil,
it employs compound expressions.<fn 2> Each type, of
course, uses its peculiar `modes,' the Dithyramb the
Phrygian and Hypophrygian, the Nome the Lydian
system of the singers to the lyre. The Dithyramb
seems to have developed out of the country festivities
and the merrymaking at drinking-bouts, while the
Nome is probably derived from the Paean, the former
being of general application, a supplication composed
to avert evil, the latter a private and personal appeal
to Apollo. Hence the Nome is without the element
of `possession' which is found in the Dithyramb.
For while in that we find drinking and sport, in the
Nome we find supplications and great orderliness,
since the actual deity concerned pervades the music,
which is orderly and systematically constructed.

<beg fn>
<fn 1>i.e. in the time of Proclus' authority
<fn 2>or uses a phraseology twice as copious<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>295

  <beg eng>Hephaestion On Poems: `Free' verse is that
which is written as it were at random and without
any definite metre, like the lyre-sung nomes of
Timotheus.

  Aristotle Problems: Why are Nomes not written
antistrophically like the choral songs? Is it because
they were sung by professional actors who were
naturally able to employ mimetic gesture and to
extend themselves at will, with the result that their
song became long and of varied shape, and the
melody, like the words, went with the action and
varied continually? For the mimetic element is
more indispensable to the air than to the words. In
the same way Dithyrambs, having become mimetic,
are no longer, as they once were, antistrophic; and
the reason is that in the old days they were danced
by the ordinary citizen, and many found mimetic
singing difficult, with the result that they employed
in them the enharmonic style, because frequent
modulation is easier for one than for many, and
easier for the professional actor than for those who
remain in their own character; and thus the poems
they composed for them were simple, which is typical
of the antistrophic system, involving as it does a
recurring unit. It is for the same reason that what
is sung upon the stage is not antistrophic, while the
songs of the chorus are so. For the actor is a
professional artist and a natural mimic, whereas the
chorus does not carry its mimicry so far.

  Pollux Onomasticon: The parts of the Lyre-sung
Nome as arranged by Terpander are seven, namely
the beginning, the after-beginning, the turning-down,
the after-turning-down,<fn 1> the navel or middle,
the seal, and the epilogue.<fn 2>

<beg fn>
<fn 1>the meaning of these two terms is unknown, perh.
`settling down to the subject'
<fn 2>it is unlikely that this division goes back to Terpander<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>297

  <beg eng>Aristotle Metaphysics: If there had been no
Timotheus, much of our lyric poetry would have been
lost to us, and if there had been no Phrynis there
would have been no Timotheus.

that all Greece honoured Timotheus for his skill with the

Life

  Aristotle Rhetoric: But the poets whose works
are in everybody's hands are those who write (not
to be performed but) to be read, such as Chaeremon,
whose style is as finished as that of a professional
speech-writer, and among the dithyrambic poets,
Licymnius.

  The Same: The beauty or ugliness of a word
consists in the first place, according to Licymnius, in
the sounds of which it is composed or the meaning
which it conveys.

  The Same: Now a term should be applied only
in speaking of a class and a real distinction; otherwise
it is empty and mere nonsense, like the term
used by Licymnius in his Art, where he speaks of
`speeding-on' and `aberration' and `ramifications.'

  Scholiast on the passage: (a) Licymnius, who
was one of the dithyramb-writers, was an accurate
writer of prose;<fn 1> (b) Licymnius was an orator; it
was to repetition that he gave the name of
`speeding-on.'

  Plato Phaedrus [on rhetoric]: And what of Polus
and his so-called shrines of learned speech<fn 2> -- diplasiology
(or word-repetition), gnomology (or the
making of sententious remarks), iconology (or the
use of metaphors), and all the other -ologies passing
under the name of Licymnius and presented by him
to Polus by way of improving his style?

<end fn>
<PN>337

  <beg eng>Scholiast on the passage: Licymnius was the
teacher of Polus; he divided nouns into proper,
compound, cognate, epithet, and other.

  Dionysius of Halicarnassus The Fine Technique
of Demosthenes [on Plato]: And as if this were not
enough, in the very next sentence there is an
example of the same thing: `We require a speech
which will give the dead adequate praise and the
living kindly exhortation.' Does not adverb contrast
with adverb and verb with verb, `adequately'
with `kindly' and `praise' with `exhortation'? are
not these examples of `balance'? And these are
not the phrases of a Licymnius or an Agathon with
their<end eng> `u(/bris <beg eng>or<end eng> Ku/pris,' <beg eng>`outrage or Love,' their<end eng>

getting any nearer to taking it, and was greatly afraid that

with him to betray the town if he would marry her according
to the laws of the Persians, and with the help of certain

to the summit, where no guards were placed owing to the

Yet the best judge of the properties of a drug is to

that Prodicus finished the education of Theramenes,

`Unlike Philoxenus son of Eryxis, who is said to
have blamed Nature and wished that he had had
the neck of a crane so as to have the greater
pleasure in eating.'<fn 2>

  The Same [on the same subject]: Other authorities
vouch for Philoxenus' weakness for fish;
Aristotle, more broadly, speaks to his love of his
dinner, where he says: `They spend the whole day
holding forth to chance audiences at the puppet-shows
or to travellers just arrived from Phasis or the
Borysthenes, though they have never read anything
but Philoxenus' Banquet, and indeed have never
finished that.' According to Phaenias, the poet
Philoxenus of Cythera, etc.<fn 3>

Banquet of Philoxenus the Leucadian<fn 4> thus:--`A.
While I am here in the wilds I am going to read
myself this book.--B. Why, what on earth is that?--A.
A new cookery-book by Philoxenus.--B. Give

and of him with `the Leucadian,' is not certain; Ath. 4.

both hand and mouth to heat he might the more
readily tackle hot food. For it was said of him that
he would suborn the cooks at a dinner to serve the
food extremely hot, so that he might despatch the
whole of a dish while his neighbours were perforce
waiting for it to cool.' The same tale is told of
Philoxenus of Cythera.<fn 1>

<TT>PHILOXENUS OF CYTHERA

Life

  Suidas Lexicon: Philoxenus: -- Son of Eulytides,<fn 2>
of Cythera, lyric poet; wrote twenty-four Dithyrambs;
died at Ephesus. When Cythera was enslaved
by the Athenians,<fn 3> he was bought by a
certain Agesylus and brought up by him, and was
called Myrmex or the Ant.<fn 4> He received his
education after the death of Agesylus, when he
became the property of the lyric poet Melanippides.<fn 5>
According to Callistratus he belonged to
the city of Heraclea in Pontus. He wrote a
Genealogy of the Aeacids in lyric verse.

  Parian Chronicle: From the time when Philoxenus
the dithyramb-writer died at the age of 55, one
hundred and sixteen years, in the archonship of
Pytheas at Athens.<fn 6>

  <beg eng>Dionysius of Halicarnassus Literary Composition:
The older lyric poets, by which I mean Alcaeus
and Sappho, wrote in short stanzas; their few lines
admitted but few variations, and they used the
epode very sparingly. Poets like Stesichorus and
Pindar, however, made their sentences longer and
distributed them among many metres and lines
simply from a desire for variety. The dithyramb-writers
went further. They varied the styles, using
Dorian, Phrygian, and Lydian in one and the same
poem; modulated the melodies, making them at
one time enharmonic, at another chromatic, and at
another diatonic; and persisted in doing what they
liked with the rhythms. This is true at least of
the school of Philoxenus, Timotheus and Telestes;
with its earlier exponents the dithyramb was of
regular shape. Prose, on the other hand, enjoys
complete freedom to adorn its structure with all
the variations it chooses.

  Plutarch On Music [on the decay of music]: The
comic poet Aristophanes mentions Philoxenus, saying
that he introduced lyric (solo-)songs into the
circular choruses.<fn 1>

  The Same: It is clear that improvement or the
reverse comes by way of the various schools and
systems, from a passage of Aristoxenus, where he
gives the following account of his contemporary
Telesias of Thebes. This man, as it happened, was
instructed in the best music and learnt the works of
the great composers, including Pindar, Dionysius the
Theban, Lamprus, Pratinas, and all the other lyric

<PN>367

<beg eng>poets who were good string-musicians. Not only
this, but he became an excellent player of the flute,
and also received an adequate general education. No
sooner, however, had he come to man's estate than
he fell so completely under the influence of the overelaborate
popular music, as to despite the excellent
tradition in which he had been reared, and direct
himself to mastering the productions of Philoxenus
and Timotheus -- and not all of them, but only the
most elaborate and innovating. He now began to
compose; but his experiments in both styles, the
Pindaric and the Philoxenean, left him unsuccessful
in the latter. Such was the influence of the excellent
training of his early years.

  Philodemus On Music: If we compare the dithyrambic
styles of Pindar and Philoxenus we shall find
a great difference in the characters presented but
an identity of style.

  Scholiast on Aristophanes Plutus [on the loves
of Laãs]: ... Laãs was the daughter of Timandra,
who was of Hyccara in Sicily. Timandra was given
by the Sicilian tyrant Dionysius to Philoxenus the
dithyramb-writer, and accompanied him to Corinth,
where she became notorious, finding many lovers
and much fame as a courtesan.<fn 1>

  Diodorus of Sicily Historical Library:<fn 2> Turning
now to Sicily, we find the Syracusan despot
Dionysius enjoying peace and tranquillity after the
anxieties of the Carthaginian War. He now set to
work with enthusiasm on the writing of poetry,

<beg fn>
<fn 1>there is confusion hereabouts between the two courtesans
named Laãs, and the latter part of this sentence may not
refer to P.

<end fn>
<PN>369

<beg eng>summoning all the famous poets to his court, raising
them to positions of honour, and submitting his
exercises to their constant criticism. The beneficence
he showed them led to flattery, and flattery
to conceit, till he prided himself far more upon his
poems than upon his success in the field. One of
his preceptors, the dithyramb-writer Philoxenus,
whose own poetical style secured him high consideration,
was asked one day at an after-dinner
recital of the despot's villainous poems to give the
author his opinion of them; and his opinion proved
to be so candid that Dionysius took umbrage, and
soundly rating him for letting envy override truth
commanded the attendants to consign him forthwith
to the stone-quarry. The next day, his friends
urging him to pardon the misdemeanour, he made
it up with the poet, and had dinner laid for
the same company. But as the evening wore on,
he was again boasting about his poems, quoting
what he considered really successful lines and asking,
`What do you think of that?' To which the
poet made no answer but to call the despot's
attendants and bid them hale him to the stone-quarry.<fn 1>
Now, however, Dionysius smiled at his
wit and bore with his outspokenness -- for laughter
turned the edge of his affront -- and common friends
of both begging the despot to overlook the poet's
ill-timed candour, Philoxenus made his patron the

<beg fn>
<fn 1>this became a proverb `of those who will not submit
to unworthy treatment,' Suid.<end eng> a)/page ktl.; <beg eng>cf. Cic. Att. 4.
6. 2, Stob. Fl. 13. 16, App. Paroem. 2. 26<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>371

<beg eng>unexpected promise that his answer should preserve
both the truth and Dionysius' reputation. He was
true to his word. The despot's citations, it seems,
were descriptive of something pathetic, and in
answer to the request for his opinion Philoxenus
now replied, `Pitiable,' and by this equivoque made
his promise good. For Dionysius took the word
`pitiable' in the sense of `pathetic, full of pathos,'
and knowing that pathos was one of the points of a
good poet, understood the criticism as praise, while
the company, accepting the real sense `utterly
pitiable,' realised that the prince was guilty of a
genuine lapse.<fn 1>

  Lucian Against the Uncultured Man who bought many
Books: It is said that Dionysius wrote tragedy of a
sort so entirely feeble and ridiculous as to cause the
repeated consignment of Philoxenus to the stone-quarry
because he could not forbear to laugh at it.
Realising that he was being put to scorn, the despot
procured at great pains the writing-tablet which
had been used by Aeschylus, and flattered himself
that he would draw inspiration from it. But alas!
he wrote still worse -- for instance, `Came Dionysius'
wife Doridium'; and, `Ah me! I've lost a serviceable
wife,' that too came from the writing-tablet;
and again, `The fools that are among us mock
themselves.' Now this last citation Dionysius might
have applied pat to your case. Had he done so,
he would have deserved to have that writing-tablet
gilded for him.

  Suidas Lexicon: The letter of Philoxenus: -- A
saying of those who refuse to do what they are

<beg fn>
<fn 1>cf. the inscription quoted on p. 260<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>373

<beg eng>asked. It seems that after his escape from the
Syracusan stone-quarry to which he had been consigned
for failing to praise the tragedies of the
tyrant Dionysius, Philoxenus of Cythera was sent
for by his late patron from Tarentum where he now
lived. He determined not to reply by ordinary
letter, but took a roll of paper and merely inscribed
in it a succession of O's, thus indicating that he
refused to return.<fn 1>

  Scholiast on Aristides:<fn 2> (1) After his flight
Dionysius wrote to Philoxenus urging him to return
and promising that he would find him a
generous host. But he replied by a letter which
contained nothing but a row of O's, by which he
meant, `You are nothing to me, I don't care,
I won't come to such as you. Go weep, go
wail, go hang!'<fn 3> -- (2) Philoxenus of Cythera, after
making his escape from the stone-quarry to which
the despot Dionysius had committed him for refusing
to praise his tragedies, was living at Crotona
in Italy, when Dionysius heard of it and requested
him to return to Syracuse. Whereupon he took
paper and wrote in the middle of the page a small
O, and a larger one round it, and a still larger one
round that -- like this,<fn 4> and when he had filled the
paper with concentric O's sent the paper off to
Dionysius as an emphatic and repeated `No.'
Hence the proverb `The O of Philoxenus' of
emphatic denials. It is such a denial that Aristides

<beg fn>
<fn 1>see below
<fn 2>cf. Plut. Tranq. 12, Apostol. 6. 68,
Diogen. 8. 54, App. Paroem. 5. 16

does not begin with O, is either corrupt or an explanation of
the previous word; in the latter case it may or may not be
an interpolation
<fn 4>a figure in the mss<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>375

<beg eng>makes here. -- His words `Bade him go hang with
the utmost outspokenness' are to be explained thus:
such a denial is as though he said to him, `Go
hang!'<fn 1>

  Plutarch Against Borrowing: Why give such instances
when the lyric poet Philoxenus, having been
assigned a farm in a Sicilian colony with plenty to
live on and an excellent house, exclaimed when he
perceived luxury, soft living, and want of refinement
to be general in that country, `Such things shall
not be my fate; I'll leave them to theirs,'<fn 2> and so
handed over the farm to another man and left the
district.

  Lucian On Not Believing Slander too Readily:
Sometimes, however, the hearer himself provides
the opportunity for the slander, and the ill-disposed
succeed by accommodating themselves to his
temperament ... If he be poetically inclined and
prides himself upon it they exclaim, `By Zeus,
Philoxenus did scoff at your lines! -- pulled them
to pieces and said they were unmetrical and wrongly
constructed.'

  Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: In respect of such
sallies of wit Stratonicus became an emulator of
the poet Simonides, if we may believe Ephorus
in the 2nd Book of his treatise On Inventions, where
moreover he declares that Philoxenus of Cythera
had a similar bent.

  Diogenes Laertius [on ArcesilaÅs]: To a disputant

<PN>377

<beg eng>he told the story of Philoxenus and the brickmakers.
One day Philoxenus found the brickmakers singing
a song of his own badly, and immediately trampled
the bricks they were making underfoot, exclaiming,
`As you destroy things of mine, I destroy things of
yours.'

  Appendix to Stobaeus Anthology [from the Tracts
of Aristonymus and from Socrates]: The musician
Philoxenus, when asked what was the chief aid to
education, replied `Time.'

  The Same [from the works of Democritus, Epictetus,
and other philosophers, poets and orators]:
Philoxenus advised us to honour our teachers more
than our parents, because our parents cause us to
live but our teachers to live well.

  Suidas Lexicon: Antigeneides: -- Son of Satyrus;

  Aristotle Politics: All revelry and all similar
forms of excitement belong, of all instruments, to
the flute, and receive their proper expression, of
all the `modes,' in the Phrygian. Thus the
Dithyramb appears to be admitted on all hands
to be a Phrygian form; and of this many proofs
are offered by competent authorities, notably
Philoxenus' failure to compose his Dithyramb The
Mysians in the Dorian mode; for he was driven
by the nature of the case to fall back on the
appropriate mode, the Phrygian.

  <beg eng>Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner [on gourmets]:
According to Polemon, the painter Androcydes of
Cyzicus, who was a lover of fish, carried his luxury
to such a pitch as to depict the fish swimming
around his Scylla with the most careful accuracy.
The love of fish shown by Philoxenus of Cythera,<fn 1>
the dithyramb-writer, is thus described by the comic
poet Machon:

<v begin>
Philoxenus, maker of dithyrambs,
Was, so men say, a mighty epicure.
He bought at Syracuse a cuttle-fish
Two cubits long, which, duly dressed for table,
He ate, save for the headpiece, well-nigh whole;
Seized with an indigestion he fell sick;
The doctor came, saw he was in sad case,
And cried, `If your estate needs ordering,
Order it quickly; at an hour past noon
You'll die.' `All's done,' says he, `all's long been
done.
My dithyrambs, praise to Heaven, I bequeath
Full-grown and wreathe\d;<fn 2> them I do entrust<fn 3>
To the Muses, my milk-sisters, to be wards
Of Aphrodite and Dionysus; such
Is my last will and testament. But now
Since Charon from TimotheÅs' Niobe\
Suffers me not to tarry, but shouts "Come,
The ferry waits!"<fn 4> and dark imperious Fate
Calls me -- O, that I may trot off, my friends,
With all I have, give me my cuttle-ends!'
<v end>

<beg fn>
<fn 1>there is confusion between the P.'s here and prob. also
in Machon, who flourished at Alexandria 300-260 B.C.
<fn 2>double meaning, `prize-winners' and `entitled to dine as
ephebi,' i.e. over 18, cf. Anacr. 45
<fn 3>with secondary meaning `dedicate'
<fn 4>lit. has room<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>381

<beg eng>And in another part he says:

<v begin>
Philoxenus, they say, he of Cythera
Wished that his throat had been three cubits
long,
To make his drinking last as long's could be
And all his victuals give him equal joy.
<v end>

And Diogenes the Cynic died of an over-loaded
stomach<fn 1> from eating a cuttle-fish raw. Of
Philoxenus Sopater the parodist writes as follows:

<v begin>
For in between two feasts of fish he sits
And gazes straight into the side of Etna.<fn 2>
<v end>

  Polybius Histories: It is a matter of common
knowledge that the Arcadian system is almost
unique. In Arcadia the children are by law taught
first to sing the hymns and paeans with which each
community according to its custom honours the
heroes and Gods. Later they learn the `nomes'
of Philoxenus and Timotheus and dance them in
keen competition every year for the Dionysiac flute-players
in the theatres, the boys competing in the
children's contests and the young men in what are
called the men's contests. Nay, in like manner at
all times when they dine together they rather call
upon each member of the company for his song than
employ professional musicians to entertain them.

<end fn>
<PN>383

<beg eng>praises as follows: `The poet Philoxenus stands in a
class by himself. In the first place he uses new
words of his own everywhere. Secondly, how well
he mingles his music with changes of time and key!
He was a God among men; for he knew what true
music is. As for the poets of to-day, setting other
men's tunes to their miserable words they write
ivy-wreathed, fountain-clear, flower-hovering, but
miserable, stuff.'

<TT>THE DITHYRAMBS OF PHILOXENUS OF
CYTHERA

<N>1-11 Cyclops or Galatea

  <CT begin>Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: According to Phaenias, the
poet Philoxenus of Cythera, who loved a good dinner, supping
one day with Dionysius and observing that the prince was
served with a large mullet and himself with a small one,
took his mullet up and put it to his ear. When Dionysius
asked why he did so, he replied that being engaged on his
Galatea he wanted his fish to give him news of Nereus'
country, and that she had answered `I have been caught too
young to understand it; Dionysius' mullet is older and can
give you all information.' Whereupon the prince burst out
laughing and sent him his own fish. It seems that Philoxenus
was one of Dionysius' favourite bottle-companions, and when
he was caught one day in the arms of his patron's mistress
Galatea, he was committed to the stone-quarry. And it was
there that he composed the Cyclops story to fit to his own
history, modelling his Cyclops on Dionysius, his nymph
Galatea on Galatea the flute-player, and Odysseus on himself.<end eng><CT end>
<PN>385

  <CT begin><beg eng>Aelian Miscellanies: The Sicilian stone-quarries were
situated near Epipolae, and measured two hundred yards
by sixty. Some of the prisoners they contained had been
there so long that they had married and got children within
them, and among these were not a few who having never set
eyes on a town were so amazed when they went into Syracuse
and saw teams of horses driven by shouting drivers that they
fled shrieking away. The best of the caves in the quarries
was known as that of the poet Philoxenus, being the quarters
in which he snapped his fingers at the punishment meted out
to him by Dionysius, and so effectively courted the Muse in
the midst of his sufferings as to compose in that prison his
finest lyric poem The Cyclops.<CT end>

  <CT begin>Hermesianax Leontium [from a catalogue of love-affairs]:
And the man from Cythera, whom Athens nursed and bred
to be the Muses' most loyal steward of Bacchus and the flute,
to wit Philoxenus, well thou knowest, Leontium, what was
the wound he suffered at Ortygia are he passed through this
city,<fn 1> for thou wottest of the great love wherewith Galatea
inspired e'en her sheep-attendants.<fn 2><CT end>

  <CT begin>Scholiast on Theocritus: According to Duris, Polyphemus
built a temple to Galatea on the side of Etna because of the
excellent pasturage and the abundant supply of milk, but
Philoxenus of Cythera, living there and so being unable to
give a fictitious reason like that, made Polyphemus the
lover of Galatea.<CT end>

  <CT begin>Didymus on Demosthenes: `The man who came from
Macedonia was so willing to take risks that in his desire to
extend his rule he became maimed for life in battle against
his enemies': -- .. It was at the siege of Methone\ that
Philip lost his right eye by an arrow while he was inspecting
the siege-engines... The story of the fluteplayer is
accepted, among other historians, by Marsyas. It seems
that at a musical competition held by Philip a short time
before the loss of his eye, all the competing fluteplayers, by
a strange coincidence, performed the Cyclops, Antigeneides
that of Philoxenus, Chrysogonus that of Stesichorus, and
Timotheus that of Oeniades.<CT end>

  Come up, my little ones, come, with cries multitudinous

the dithyramb-writer who wrote about the love of the
Cyclops for Galatea; and he imitates the sound of the
lyre in his book with the word<end eng> qrettanelo/ <beg eng>or ting-a-ling.
For he introduces the Cyclops playing the lyre in order to
win Galatea's affection. -- (2) Philoxenus the dithyramb-writer
was with Dionysius in Sicily. It is said that he once
seduced a woman called Galatea who was Dionysius' mistress,
and when he learnt of it Dionysius consigned him to the
stone-quarry. Escaping thence he retired to the highlands
of Cythera and there composed a drama called Galatea, in
which he made the Cyclops Galatea's lover, thus hinting at
Dionysius, whom he likened to the Cyclops, because Dionysius'
sight, like his, was not of the best.<CT end>

move the door aside -- or rather this doorstone, which seemeth
to me a very promontory -- and I will subdue the maid and
rejoin thee quicker than the saying of it. Subdue? nay, I
will show thee herself lured hither by many a charm; and
she shall be thy suppliant, and thou shalt play coy dissembler.
Yet this much giveth me thought, lest the smell of the goat
in the fleeces disturb a maid that lives softly and washeth
herself many times a day. It were well then that thou
shouldst both put all in order and sweep and wash and
fumigate thy chamber, and better still if thou preparedst
crowns of ivy and woodbine to crown thyself and thy love
withal. O why tarriest thou? puttest thou not thy hand
e'en now to the door?' At this Polyphemus burst out laughing
his very loudest and clapped his hands together; and
Odysseus thought he was in transports of joy at the expectation
that his love should be his. But Polyphemus only
chucked him under the chin and said `Noman, thou seem'st
to be a mighty shrewd manikin and well versed in the affairs
of life; but now thou must fain broider thee a different robe,
for from this place thou shalt not escape.' Odysseus, who
was truly being wronged, was in the event, we know, to get
the advantage in knavery. But you, who are a Cyclops in
strength and a Sisyphus in attempt, are caught by Justice
and held fast by Law, both of which you perhaps despise.
Yet if you must overcome the laws altogether, I only hope I

being informed, when he asked the reason, that all the fish
had been bought up for a wedding, took a bath and went

in Polyi+dus the sophist, where Orestes naturally infers that
as his sister has been sacrificed so he must now share her
fate.<CT end>

  <CT begin>The Same: Subjects already invented should nevertheless
be sketched out in general by the poet himself before being
arranged in episodes and worked out in detail. He should
investigate the general plan, for example, of an Iphigeneia
thus: -- A young girl has been sacrificed and has then
mysteriously vanished from the sight of her sacrificers and
been transported to a country where it is customary to
sacrifice all strangers to the God, and there become priestess.
Some time afterwards her brother happens to arrive there.
The fact that he has been sent there by the oracle for some
reason, the purpose of his coming, is outside the story.
However, he comes, is seized, and is about to be sacrificed,
when he makes the recognition. This may be either in the
manner of Euripides or of Polyi+dus, who makes him say very
naturally that it was not only his sister, then, who was to
perish by sacrifice -- a remark which saves his life.<CT end>

To Hermeias<fn 2>

  <CT begin>Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner [scolia or drinking-songs]:
Democritus now remarked that the poem written by the
most learned of men, Aristotle, to Hermeias of Atarneus,
was not a paean as was asserted by Demophilus, who at
the instigation of Eurymedon instituted the proceedings
against the philosopher and laid the outrageous accusation
of impiety, on the plea that he daily sang a paean in honour
of Hermeias<fn 3> at the common board of the Peripatetic School.
`As a matter of fact' said he `the poem bears no resemblance
to the paean, but is a particular kind of scolion such
as we have just been discussing, and this I will show you
plainly from what it says:<CT end>

  Virtue, laborious prize of mortals and noblest
quest of life, 'tis the most enviable lot in Greece to
die or suffer bitter toil unceasing for thy maiden
beauty, such the heaven-rivalling fruit thou bestowest

birth, better than soft-eyed sleep. For thee did
Heracles, for thee did those other sons of Zeus that
Leda brought him, bear much in vigorous search of
thy power and art; for love of thee went Ajax and
Achilles to the house of Death; and now for thy

  <CT begin>Now I do not know whether anyone can see anything here
characteristic of the paean. The writer clearly admits that
Hermeias is dead ..., and there is no paeanic refrain as
there is in the real paean to the Spartan Lysander which, in
his book entitled Annals of Samos, Duris declares is sung
in that city ... And moreover Aristotle says himself, in
his Defence from the Accusation of Impiety -- if the speech is
genuine -- ``If I had intended to sacrifice to Hermeias as an
immortal being I should not have built him the tomb of a
mortal, nor if I had wished to make him a God should I have
honoured his remains with funeral obsequies.'''<CT end>

<CT begin>Clearchus in the Same [why, when a man's wreath comes

betrayed by their passion into despoiling themselves of a

them, as they rightly think, of a spiritual? That is what
every lover does if the beloved be there; and if not, he
dedicates it to whoever is -- which is the reason why
Lycophronides makes his lovesick goatherd say:<CT end>

  This rose, with my cap and shoes and gameslaying
javelins, is my fair offering to thee,<fn 3> though
my thoughts lie otherwhere, to wit on the lass
Acacallis whom the Graces love so well.

  <beg eng>Plutarch Music: The second establishment of
music at Sparta is best ascribed to Thaletas of
Gortyn, Xenodamus of Cythera, Xenocritus of Locri,
Polymnastus of Colophon and Sacadas of Argos ..
Thaletas, Xenodamus, and Xenocritus were composers
of paeans .. though according to some
authorities, as for instance Pratinas, Xenodamus
composed hyporchemes and not paeans. There is
actually a song of Xenodamus' on record, which is
obviously a hyporcheme .. As to Xenocritus, who
was by birth of Locri in Italy, it is questioned
whether or no he was a composer of paeans, because
we are told that he wrote poems on `heroic' subjects,
and that some writers therefore called his works
dithyrambs. According to Glaucus, Thaletas was
an older contemporary of Xenocritus.<fn 1>

  Plutarch Music: We are told that the last lyrist
to win the prize for lyre-song at the Spartan Carneia
was a Lesbian called Pericleitus;<fn 2> his death put an
end to the continuous succession of Lesbian singers
to the lyre. Some writers are mistaken in making
Hipponax a contemporary of Terpander. The truth
would appear to be that he comes later even than
Pericleitus.

[Arion's] Hymn to Poseidon

  <CT begin>Aelian On Animals: That dolphins have a natural liking
for singing and the flute, witness Arion of Methymna by
token of the statue<fn 2> at Cape Taenarum and the inscription
thereon, which runs `By immortal guidance this equipage
saved Arion son of Cycleus from the Sicilian main.' The
hymn of thanksgiving to Poseidon which testifies to the
dolphins' love of music was composed by Arion<fn 3> as a meed of
gratitude not only to him but to them. It is as follows:<CT end>

  Chiefest of Gods, sea-lord Poseidon of the trident
of gold, earth-shaking king of the swelling<fn 4> brine,
the beasts that swim dance all about thee with fins,
and lightly bound with nimble flingings of the foot,
the snub-nosed coursing hounds of bristling mane,
the dolphin-lovers of the Muse, sea-creatures of
Nereus' goddess-daughters that he had of Amphitrite,
the beasts that bore a wanderer on the Sicilian
sea to Taenarum's shore in Pelops' land, ploughing
the untrodden furrow of Nereus' field astride their
humped back, when crafty men had cast me from
out the hollow wave-going ship into the sea-purple
billows of the ocean.

Introduction

  Pollux Onomasticon: Songs to the Gods are called
in general paeans or hymns, in particular a hymn to
Artemis is known as<end eng> ou)/piggos, <beg eng>to Apollo as the
paean. Both these are addressed in processional
songs, Dionysus in the dithyramb, Demeter in the<end eng>
i)/oulos. <beg eng>The Linus and Lityerses are the songs of
delvers and husbandmen.

  Herodotus Histories [Arge\ and Opis]: For according
to them the women go begging gifts for them,
calling upon their names in the hymn composed for
them by a Lycian named Olen ... This Olen it
was who came from Lycia and composed this and
the other ancient hymns that are sung at Delos.

  Callimachus Hymn to Delos: The men sing the
song of the Lycian ancient, the song the prophet
Olen brought from the bank of Xanthus, and the
maidens that dance to them beat with their feet the
stable earth.

  Iliad: All the day long they worshipped the God<fn 1>
with music, singing the beautiful Paean, these sons
of the Achaeans, making music to the Far-darter;
and his heart rejoiced to hear them.<fn 2>

  Archilochus: Myself leading with the flute the
Lesbian paean.

  <beg eng>Iliad [the Shield of Achilles]: And therein he made
two fair cities of mortal men; in the one were
weddings and feasts, and they led the brides from
their chambers amid the light of torches through
the town, and loud rose the bridal song. Young
men whirled in the dance, and flute and lyre cried
aloud among them, while the women stood each at
her door marvelling at them.<fn 1>

  Hesiod [the Shield of Heracles]: And on the
other side was a rout of young men with flutes
playing, some frolicking with dance and song, others
laughing, each and all in time with the flute-player
as they went along.

  Plutarch Life of Alcibiades: The motion was
carried and all was ready for the sailing of the
expedition,<fn 2> when there befel unfavourable portents,
not least that of the feast of Adonis, which falling
at this time, in many places images were set out
like corpses for burial by the Athenian women, who
beat their breasts and sang dirges in mimic funeral
rites.

  Aeschylus Libation-Bearers:

  Electra: I made lament in Arian<fn 3> wise, or to the
tunes of the Cissian<fn 3> mourner; aye, then behold
hands outstretched one after other, striking desperately,
wandering wildly, upward, downward, my
miserable stricken head ringing again to their
beat.

  Iliad [the funeral of Hector]: And when they had
brought him into the famous house, then laid they

<end fn>
<PN>493

<beg eng>him upon a fretted bed and set beside it minstrels
for to lead the dirge, the which did make lament
of mournful song, while the women wailed in answer
to them.

  The Same [the Shield of Achilles]: And lasses
and lads in childish glee carried the honey-sweet
fruit<fn 1> in plaited baskets, while in their midst a boy
did harp delightfully upon a sweet clear lute, and
sang the fair Song of Linus<fn 2> in a piping voice, the
rest following with dancing feet that kept time with
his playing and his song.

  Scholiast on the passage [`sang the fair song of
Linus']: ... that is the song first sung in honour
of Linus the darling of Apollo, a little boy who was
torn in pieces by sheep-dogs ... but Aristarchus
says that it is a sort of hymn, as if he said `sang a
paean' or the like.

  Callixeinus of Rhodes [the festal procession of
Philadelphus]: There were sixty Satyrs treading the
grapes, singing to the flute the Song of the Wine-press,
with Silenus for their overseer.

  Longus Daphnis and Chloe: Displaying all the art
of pastoral music, he showed upon the pipe what
notes were fit for the herds of cows and oxen, what
agreed with the flocks of goats, what were pleasing
to the sheep.<fn 3>

  The Same: But Dryas, rising and bidding him
pipe a Dionysiac tune, fell to dancing before them the
Dance of the Winepress. And now he acted to the
life the cutting and gathering of the grapes, now
the carrying of the baskets, then the treading of the
grapes in the press, then presently the tunning of

<beg fn>
<fn 1>grapes
<fn 2>or sang of the fair Linus
<fn 3>Thornley (as revised in the L.C.L.)<end eng>

<PN>495

<beg eng>the wine into the butts, and then again their joyful
and hearty carousing the must. All these things he
represented so aptly and clearly in his dancing, that
they all thought they verily saw before their face
the vines, the grapes, the press, the butts, and that
Dryas did drink indeed.<fn 1>

  The Same: And when they had made a libation
from the bowl to Dionysus, they fell to their meat,
with ivy crowns upon their heads. And when it
was time, having cried the Iacchus and Euoe, they
sent Daphnis away.<fn 1>

  The Same: They sang, too, certain songs in the
praise of the Nymphs, the solemn carmens of the
ancient shepherds.<fn 1>

  Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: In the second Book
of his Appellations Tryphon gives the following list
of the different kinds of song: `The Himaeus is the
Mill-song, which they sang as they ground the corn.<fn 2>
The word perhaps comes from himalis, which in Doric
means the ``return'' or over-measure of wheat-flour.<fn 3>
The Weavers' song is known as Elinus,<fn 4> as we know
from Epicharmus' Atalantae. This is the<end eng> i)/oulos <beg eng>of the
spinners.'<fn 5> To quote Semus the Delian's work On
Paeans: `The trusses or handfuls of barley were
known individually as<end eng> a)ma/lai; <beg eng>collectively a bunch

<beg eng>Thus both the corn and the hymns to the Goddess

dhmh/troulos <beg eng>and<end eng> kalli/oulos, <beg eng>and also in the song `A
sheaf, a sheaf, send, send a great sheaf.'<fn 1> But according
to other authorities the word means a
Spinning-song. Nursing-songs are called<end eng> katabaukalh/seis
<beg eng>or Lullabies. There was also a song sung
to Erigone\ at the Swing-Feast, called the<end eng> a)lh=tis <beg eng>or
Wandering-song. Compare Aristotle in the Constitution
of Colophon: `Theodorus himself came later
to a violent end. He seems to have been a luxurious
liver, to judge by his poetry, for even to this day
the women sing his songs over the swings.' The
Reaping-song is called Lityerses. And according to
Telecleides' Amphictyons there was a song of the
hired labourers who went out to the farms, and
others, as Crates tells us in his Daring Deeds, of the
bathmen, and yet another, according to Aristophanes'
Thesmophoriazusae<fn 2> and Nicochares' Heracles as Chorus-Leader,
of the women who winnow the corn. Moreover
the tenders of cattle and sheep had a song, the<end eng>
boukoliasmo/s <beg eng>or Herding-song. The inventor of this
was a Sicilian oxherd called Diomus, who is mentioned
in the Halcyon and Odysseus Shipwrecked of
Epicharmus. The song sung at deaths and in
mourning is called the<end eng> o)lofurmo/s <beg eng>or Wailing. The
songs called<end eng> i)/ouloi <beg eng>belong to Demeter and Persephone\.

<beg eng>Charondas, as we learn from the sixth Book of
Hermippus' work On the Lawgivers. In his Atticisms
Aristophanes [of Byzantium] states: `The Himaeus
is the song of the millers;<fn 1> the Hymenaeus is the
song sung at weddings; in mourning they sang the
Ialemus or Lament; the Linus and Ailinos were
sung not only on occasions of mourning, but also, in
Euripides' phrase, ``for the singing of prosperity.'' '

  In the first Book of his Erotica Clearchus says that
there was a certain song called Nomian<fn 2> which
originated with Eriphanis, and he tells the tale as
follows: `The lyric poetess Eriphanis, becoming enamoured
of Menalcas when he was out hunting,
turned hunter too and pursued him with her love.
Like Io in the story they say she wandered to and fro
through all the mountain woods, till not only the
most phlegmatic of men, but the fiercest beasts, wept
with her and understood the longings of her heart.
And thus it was that she composed, they say, the
so-called Nomian or Pastoral Song, crying aloud and
singing it while she wandered in the wilds; from
this song comes the line ``The oaks grow high,
Menalcas.'' ' To quote the fourth Book of Aristoxenus
On Music, `In former times the women had a song
called Calyce\. It was a poem of Stesichorus, in
which a maiden of this name prayed to Aphrodite
that she might be wedded to a youth called
Euathlus, and when he flouted her threw herself
over a cliff. The scene was laid near Leucas. The
poet gave the maiden a very virtuous character; for
she had no wish that she and the youth should come
together at all hazards, but prayed that she might

<beg eng>if possible be his wedded wife, or failing that might
die.'<fn 1> We are told by Aristoxenus in his Brief
Notes that, Iphiclus spurning her affection, Harpalyce\
died, and the maidens made a song-competition in
her honour, called after her the Harpalyce\. We
read in the first Book of Nymphis' Heraclea, where
he is speaking of the Mariandyni, `Similarly we may
notice some of the songs, which at a feast that it
is their custom to celebrate they sing when they
invoke a person of ancient times whom they address
as Bormus. This was the son, they say, of a man
wealthy and distinguished, a youth of surpassing
beauty and vigour, who, when superintending the
work on his farm, went in quest of water for his
reapers and disappeared. Accordingly the inhabitants
of the district went in search of him with a
kind of dirge or invocation set to music, which the
whole people sing to the present day. A similar
kind of song is the Maneros, as it is called, of the
Egyptians.'

  Pollux Onomasticon [poems]: ... the various forms
of<end eng> i)/oulos, ou)/lamos, <beg eng>and<end eng> ou)/piggos, <beg eng>the Linus, the Song
of the Mill, and the Himaeus or Himalis, of which
the singer was called<end eng> i(maoido/s.<fn 2> <beg eng>There was also the
Borimus, the song of the Mariandynian farmers,
corresponding to the Egyptian Maneros and the
Phrygian Lityersas. This Maneros was the Egyptian
inventor of husbandry, a pupil of the Muses; and
Lityersas was the same among the Phrygians. Of
the latter we are told that he was a son of Midas
who used to challenge the reapers to a reaping-match
and give the losers the whip, but met his
death at the hands of one that was stronger, who

<beg eng>some say was Heracles. The dirge, which was
sung at the threshing-floors and the mowing, was to
console his father. Borimus was a brother of Iollas
and Mariandynus and son of king Upius who died
young when hunting at harvest-time. He is commemorated
in a dirge-like song about husbandry.
There was also a song known as Aletis, sung over
the swings; this was the work of Theodorus of
Colophon. And there was a Flute-piece of the
Winepress, for the treading of the grapes; and
another for the Winnowing, which is referred to by
the comedy-writer Phrynichus in his Revellers, thus:

<v begin>
I'll whistle for us a winnowing-song;
<v end>

and by Nicophon in his Hand to Belly in the line:

<v begin>
But come you and play us a winnowing on your
flute.
<v end>

And there were flute-tunes for rowers also, and for
shepherds. Epicharmus mentions a Shepherding-tune,
and Plato the comedy-writer a tune for the
Herding of Swine ...<fn 1> And according to Aristotle
the Etruscans not only box but even flog and cook
to the sound of the flute.

nothing like the Hymenaeus, but as if they had been
singing at their labour with mattock and hoe.<fn 2>

  Scholiast on Theocritus The Reapers [`Come, hear
this of the divine Lityerses']: By this he means
`Hear this tragedy [sic] of mine, which I am about
to sing concerning Lityerses'; now this Lityerses,
who lived at Celaenae in Phrygia, used to compel
passing strangers after feasting at his table to reap
with him, and when evening came would cut off
their heads, and binding the trunk into a sheaf
with the trusses of corn, would sing a song; but he
was eventually slain by Heracles and thrown into
the river Maeander. Which is why in Phrygia to
this day the reapers sing his praise as a champion
reaper.<fn 3>

<CT begin>Introduction to Theocritus [the invention of pastoral

had perished in civil strife, unity was re-established, it was
believed that the discord had been the work of Artemis.
The peasants accordingly now brought offerings and joyfully
sang the Goddess' praises, and the people afterwards made
those songs permanent and customary. It seems that they
sang them equipped with a loaf bearing several animal-shapes,
a wallet full of mixed seeds, and some wine in a
goatskin, making libations for anyone they met, with a
garland about them and the antlers of a stag on their heads,
and in their hands a hare stick or hurlbat. The winner
received the loaf carried by the loser, and remained at
Syracuse while his defeated antagonists went round the
neighbouring villages begging food. The various songs sung
by these peasants were full of fun and play and ended with
the following blessing:<CT end>

which is sung in Rhodes, and of which Theognis writes as
follows in the 2nd Book of his Rhodian Festivals: `There is a
kind of begging-round which the Rhodians call the Swallow-Round,
which takes place in the month of Boâdromion,<fn 2> and
receives its name because it is the custom to beg to the
following song:<CT end>

See! see! the Swallow is here!
She brings a good season, she brings a good year;
White is her breast and black her crest;
See, the Swallow is here.

Ho! roll a fruit-cake from your well-filled cot,
Of cheese a fair round, of wine a full pot;
Porridge she'll take, and a bite of hardbake;
She never despises good cheer.

Go we away empty to-day?
An thou wilt give us, we'll up and away;
But an thou deny us, O here we shall stay.
Shall we take your door and your lintel alsï,

Shall we take the good wife that is sitting below?
She's not so tall but we'll lift her and all -- We
can easily bear her away. [Over

the enemy with such vigour as to throw their horse into confusion
and put them to flight. The infantry now followed
them, and the Chalcidians won an overwhelming victory,

<TT>SCOLIA

Introduction

  Scholiast on Plato Gorgias: (2) Scolion is the
name of the type of song sung over the wine. It was
so called, according to Dicaearchus in his treatise on
The Musical Competitions, because there were three
kinds of song, of which the first was sung by all the
guests together, the second by all in due order one
by one, and the third by the best performers just as
it happened, the last being called, because of the
haphazard arrangement, scolia. On the other hand
Aristoxenus and Phyllis the writer on music declare
that they used to set a number of dining-couches

<beg fn>
<fn 1>to the same tradition possibly belong the Marisaeum
Melos, Powell Collect. Alex. p. 184, and the<end eng> Paraklausi/quron
<beg eng>(Grenfell's Erotic Fragment) ibid. p. 177
<fn 2>it is not clear
to whom this refers; possibly to a certain Philon mentioned
earlier, and not to `Doctor' Ulpian; but the epitomator is
probably at fault
<fn 3>after his defeat of the Spartans in the Second Messenian War<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>551

<beg eng>round one table at weddings, and the guests one
after the other sang proverbs and love-songs of a
serious type, holding twigs of myrtle or laurel. The
course followed among them was skolios or `crooked'
owing to the arrangement of the couches in polygonal
rooms, which made the seating irregular. Thus the
songs, according to these authorities, were not called
crooked because of their metrical structure but
because of the crooked course taken by the myrtletwig
as it passed from hand to hand.<fn 1> -- (3) In the
Prytaneum or Town-Hall of Athens scolia were sung
over the wine on certain men such as Harmodius,
Admetus, Telamon;<fn 2> and this type of song was so
called by antiphrasis (or saying the opposite to what
you mean), because they were easy to sing and, like
`epigrams' (or metrical inscriptions), had but few
lines, the guests offering the sprig to each other in
turn, and those who did not sing were thus shown to
be unmusical.<fn 3>

  Scholiast on Aristophanes Clouds [`And then I
told him first to take the sprig and recite me something
from Aeschylus']: To quote Dicaearchus'
Musical Competitions, `Moreover it appears to be
natural for a man who gives a recitation or a song to
do so with something in his hand. After-dinner
singers by an old-established custom sing holding a
branch of bay or myrtle.'

  Plutarch Dinner-Table Problems: We are told that
the Scolia were not a type of obscurely constructed
songs, but were so called because the ancients first
sang to the God a paean in which all the guests

points to these scolia having formed a book; cf. on 14, 15,
21, and Sch. Ar. Ach. 980 (Reitz.)

<beg eng>took part, and secondly sang one after the other as a
myrtle-sprig was passed round, this sprig being called<end eng>
ai)/sakos <beg eng>because, I take it, the guest who took it
sang<end eng> [1a)/|dein]1; <beg eng>thirdly they passed round a lyre which
every man who could play took, tuned, and sang to,
but which was refused by the unmusical,<fn 1> this last
type of song being called scolion or crooked because
it was not sung by all nor easy to sing. Other
writers state that the myrtle-spring did not go round
in order, but from a guest reclining on one couch to
a guest reclining on another; the first, having
finished his song, passed it to the first guest on the
second couch, and he to the first on the third, and
then the second in like manner to the second; and
the scolion received its name of `crooked' very
naturally from the shifting nature of the myrtle's
course.<fn 2>

  Scholiast on Aristophanes Wasps [`Mind you take
up the scolia properly']: There was an ancient
custom by which the guests at a feast sang one
after the other, beginning where their predecessor
ended. The first held a laurel or myrtle sprig and
sang some lyrics of Simonides or Stesichorus up
to a point of his own choosing, and then offered
the twig to any guest he chose, no matter where he
reclined. This guest would then continue where
the other had left off, and pass it on in his turn to
the man of his choice. The songs where called
scolia or `crooked' because of the difficulty involved
in singing or reciting the lines without due warning.

  The Same: According to some authorities it was
the custom for any guest who could not sing to the

  Scholiast on l. 1235 (above): The poet is parodying
Alcaeus, making Cleon `mad.'<fn 2>

  Compare Aristophanes in the Storks:

`The one began to sing to the myrtle-sprig ``Learn
wisdom of Admetus,'' and the other compelled him
to sing the Harmodius-song instead.'

  Herodicus, in his treatise on Persons Satirised in

  Another Scholiast: `To Cleitagora': Who was a
poetess; by `the song of Cleitagora' is meant the
song to (or on) herself, Cleitagora.

  Aristophanes Lysistrata:

Nowadays, when we arrive sober at Sparta, we
immediately look to see what mischief we can do,
and therefore what they do say we don't hear and
what they don't say we suspect, and give them
messages which contradict one another. To-day
everything pleased them, so that if anybody were
to have sung the Telamon instead of the Cleitagora,<fn 1>
we should have thanked him and forsworn ourselves.

  Scholiast on the passage: The Telamon: -- The
beginning of a scolion `Son of Telamon, spearman
Aias' ... The meaning is that we say and do
mutually inconsistent things. For when anybody
sings one of the scolia of Pindar we say that
he ought to sing one of those of the poetess
Cleitagora. Now Cleitagora was a Spartan poetess
mentioned by Aristophanes in the Daughters of
DanaÅs.<fn 2>

<TT>ATTIC SCOLIA<fn 1>

  <CT begin>Athenaeus Doctors at Dinner: Many of the guests mentioned
the well-known Attic Scolia or Drinking-Songs.
These too call for notice here because of the ancient and
simple style in which they are written, Alcaeus and
Anacreon being famous for this particular type of poem,
witness Aristophanes in the Banqueters: `Take and sing
a drinking-song of Alcaeus or Anacreon.' Another celebrated
writer of scolia was Praxilla of Sicyon. These songs
are so called not because the style of verse in which they
are written is<end eng> skolio/s <beg eng>or `crooked,' for they are said to be
reckoned among the laxer type of verse. But according to
Artemon of Casandreia in the second volume of his Use of
Books, which contains the poems sung at banquets, there
were of these three kinds, of which the first was by custom
sung by all the company together, and the second in a kind
of succession round the table in which no gaps were allowed;
the third, unlike the other two, was performed only by the
guests who were considered real musicians, regardless of the
order in which they sat, and so was called<end eng> sko/lion <beg eng>or
`crooked song' only as being irregular compared with the
others, that is, as not being sung by all together nor yet in
succession, but by some just as it might happen. Moreover
the scolia were sung after the songs which were general and
compulsory. When those were over each of the really
musical guests was asked to entertain the company to a
good song, `good' meaning one which appeared to contain
some exhortation or sentiment of practical utility.<CT end>

  <CT begin>Among the Deipnosophists or Dining Doctors, one now
recited his choice among the scolia, and another his. All
that were given will be found in the following pages.<fn 2><CT end>
