# GreekLyric
Files for Greek Lyric poetry based on 1922 Edmonds edition.

The text files are raw output from data entry firm and date from 2005. They have been waiting for us to develop reasonable support for editions of fragmentary authors. The format is basic but the data entry quality should be solid.

The Greek texts and English translations have been separated into different files.

This work is useful because (1) it is fully in the public domain and can be freely updated/augmented; (2) it contains source texts and English translations not only for the poetry but also for the contexts from which they are drawn and for the background information from Greek and Latin sources.
