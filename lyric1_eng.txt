<WW>BIOGRAPHIES

<TY>1 Oxyrhynchus papyrus (late 2nd or early 3rd c. a.d.)

On Sappho

  Sappho<fn 1> was a Lesbian by birth, of the city of
Mytilene. Her father was Scamander or, according
to some, Scamandronymus,<fn 2> and she had three
brothers, Erigyius, Larichus and Charaxus, the eldest,
who sailed to Egypt and associated with one Doricha,
spending large sums on her; Sappho was more fond
of the young Larichus.<fn 3> She had a daughter Cleis,<fn 4>
named after her own mother. She has been accused
by some of being irregular in her ways and a womanlover.
In appearance she seems to have been contemptible
and quite ugly, being dark in complexion
and of very small stature.<fn 5> The same is true of
(Alcaeus?) who was smallish<fn 6> ...

<beg fn>
<fn 1>G. Zuntz, `On the Etymology of the Name Sappo' (Mus.
Helv. 8 (1951) 12-35), argued that her name was Asianic.

<TY>2 Suda, Sappho (1st notice)

  Daughter of Simon of Eumenus or of Eerigyius<fn 1>
or of Ecrytus or of Semus or of Camon or of Etarchus
or of Scamandronymus; her mother was Cleis; a
Lesbian from Eresus, a lyric poetess; flourished<fn 2> in
the 42nd Olympiad (612/608 B.C.), when Alcaeus,
Stesichorus and Pittacus were also alive.<fn 3> She had
three brothers, Larichus, Charaxus and Eurygius.
She was married to a very wealthy man called
Cercylas,<fn 4> who traded from Andros, and she had a

generals of Alexander the Great was a Mytilenaean, Erigyius,
son of Larichus (Arr. 3. 11. 10; Diod. Sic. 17. 57. 3).
<fn 2>Or `born': see Rohde, Rh. Mus. 33 (1878) 161 ff., Saake, Sapphostudien
49, Page, S. & A.225 n. 4. The Greek verb is used
sometimes of a person's birth, sometimes of a date when he
`flourished', which may mean no more than a date at which
he was known to have been alive.
<fn 3>Alcaeus was probably
born c. 625-620; traditional dates for Stesichorus are O1.37
(632/28) to O1.56 (556/2). Pittacus is said to have been born
in O1.32 (652/48) and to have died in 570/69.
<fn 4>Aly (R.E. s.v. `Sappho', col. 2361.40) believes that his name, elsewhere
apparently unknown, and the connection with Andros, were
invented as indecent puns by the comic poets (Prick from the

  From the time when Sappho sailed in exile<fn 1> from
Mytilene to Sicily (   years)<fn 2>: the earlier Critias
was archon at Athens, and in Syracuse<fn 3> the `Gamoroi'
(Landowners) held political power.

<fn 2>The date, x years before 264/3, is lost in
the lacuna, but must lie between 605/4 (the date of the previous
entry, on Alyattes) and 591/0 (that of the following
entry): there is evidence that Critias' archonship did not fall
in the four-year period 595/4-592/1: see Cadoux, JHS 68
(1948) 70 ff, Page, S. & A. 224-6.

  At the same time as these men (sc. Alcaeus and

in all recorded history I know of no woman who even
came close to rivalling her as a poet.<fn 2>

vexing the man of Teos (sc. Anacreon) by the
eloquence of his songs. For honey-sweet Anacreon
was a rival for her love ...'<fn 2> In these lines Hermesianax
makes the mistake of believing Sappho and
Anacreon to be contemporaries; for Anacreon lived
at the time of Cyrus and Polycrates,<fn 3> Sappho at the
time of Alyattes,<fn 4> father of Croesus. Chamaeleon in
his treatise On Sappho<fn 5> actually declares that some say
it was to her that the following lines were addressed
by Anacreon (fr. 358) ... and that Sappho directed
the following lines to him<fn 6>: `You uttered that
hymn, oh golden-throned Muse, which from the fine
land of fair women the glorious old Teian man delightfully
sang.' But that this is no song of Sappho's
must be obvious to everyone. I think that Hermesianax
was joking about this love affair: Diphilus the
comic poet in his play Sappho<fn 7> has made Archilochus
and Hipponax lovers of Sappho.<fn 8>

  What else could one call the love of the Lesbian
woman than the Socratic art of love? For they seem
to me to have practised love after their own fashion,
she the love of women, he of men. For they said
they loved many, and were captivated by all things
beautiful. What Alcibiades and Charmides and
Phaedrus were to him, Gyrinna and Atthis and
Anactoria were to her; what the rival craftsmen
Prodicus and Gorgias and Thrasymachus and Protagoras
were to Socrates, Gorgo and Andromeda were
to Sappho. Sometimes she censures them, at other
times she cross-examines them, and she uses irony
just like Socrates.

Well, this skilled woman was called Damophyla, and

the Lesbians as immoral (e.g. Anacr. 358, Ar. Ran. 1308,

Adonis, and a poem of S. in which Aphrodite declared her love

What owner, public or private, should possess this

... How greatly this stolen Sappho was missed
can hardly be expressed. Not only was the statue
itself exquisitely made, but upon the base was
inscribed a very famous Greek epigram,<fn 3> which that
erudite Hellenist, a fine connoisseur of these matters,
the only man who understands them, would surely
have removed along with the statue if he had understood

since in the ancient copies we see each song marked

they were composed with the stanza as the unit; on

<TY>33 Marius Victorinus, Grammar (on the metres of
Horace)

  Although the Sapphic stanza was invented by
Alcaeus, it is called the Sapphic hendecasyllable
because of the number of syllables and because
Sappho used it more frequently than Alcaeus its
inventor. The stanza is concluded by a fourth line.
For you see that the three equal hendecasyllabic
lines (Horace, Ode 1. 2. 1-3) are not complete in
meaning unless concluded by an `epode' or shorter
line.<fn 2>

<WW>THE VERDICT OF ANTIQUITY

<TY>42 Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Demosthenes

  The next style is the elegant<fn 1> or spectacular, preferring
refinement to majesty. It always chooses
the smoothest and softest of words, hunting for
euphony and melodiousness and the sweetness that

<beg fn>
<fn 1>Luc. Imag. 18 uses this word of S.<end eng>
<end fn>

<PN>39

<beg eng>is derived from them. Secondly, it does not think it
right to place these words just as they come or to fit
them together thoughtlessly; rather, it judges what
juxtapositions will be able to make the sounds more
musical, and examines by what arrangements the
words will produce the more attractive combinations,
and so it tries to fit each word together, taking great
pains to have everything planed and rubbed down
smooth and all joints neatly dovetailed ... These
in my view are the characteristics of this style. As
examples of it I take among poets Hesiod and
Sappho<fn 2> and Anacreon, among prose authors Isocrates
the Athenian and his followers.

<beg fn>
<fn 2>See also D.H. on fr. 1 and `Longinus' on fr. 31; when schol.

we often find in Sappho and Alcman: the poets
summon Artemis from many mountains and cities,
from rivers too, and Aphrodite from Cyprus,<fn 2> Cnidos,
Syria and many other places. They can, in addition,
describe the places themselves: in the case of rivers,

my heart, mistress, with ache and anguish, but come
here, if ever in the past you heard my voice from afar
and acquiesced and came, leaving your father's golden
house, with chariot yoked: beautiful swift sparrows<end eng>

<beg eng>whirring fast-beating wings brought you above the
dark earth down from heaven through the mid-air,
and soon they arrived; and you, blessed one, with a
smile on your immortal face asked what was the
matter with me this time and why I was calling this
time and what in my maddened heart I most wished
to happen for myself: `Whom am I to persuade this
time to lead you back to her love? Who wrongs you,
Sappho? If she runs away, soon she shall pursue;
if she does not accept gifts, why, she shall give them
instead; and if she does not love, soon she shall love
even against her will.' Come to me now again and
deliver me from oppressive anxieties; fulfil all that
my heart longs to fulfil, and you yourself be my fellow-fighter.

<TY>31 `Longinus', On sublimity

Sappho, for example, always chooses the emotions associated
with love's madness from the attendant circumstances and the
real situation. Where does she display her excellence? In
that she is adept at selecting and combining the most important
and excessive concomitants:

  He seems as fortunate as the gods to me, the man
who sits opposite you and listens nearby to your
sweet voice and lovely laughter. Truly that sets
my heart trembling in my breast. For when I look
at you for a moment, then it is no longer possible<end eng>
<PN>81

<beg eng>for me to speak; my tongue has snapped,<fn 1> at once
a subtle fire has stolen beneath my flesh, I see nothing
with my eyes, my ears hum, sweat pours from me, a
trembling seizes me all over, I am greener than grass,
and it seems to me that I am little short of dying.
But all can be endured, since ... even a poor
man ...<fn 2>

  Are you not amazed how at one and the same moment she
seeks out soul, body, hearing, tongue, sight, complexion as
though they had all left her and were external, and how in contradiction
she both freezes<fn 3> and burns, is irrational and sane,
is afraid and nearly dead, so that we observe in her not one
single emotion but a concourse of emotions? All this of course
happens to people in love; but, as I said, it is her selection of
the most important details and her combination of them into
a single whole that have produced the excellence of the poem.<fn 4>

  Sometimes, also, Sappho makes charming use of repetition
as in the description of the Evening Star:

  Hesperus, bringing everything that shining Dawn
scattered, you bring the sheep, you bring the goat,
you bring back the child to its mother.

Here the charm lies in the repetition of the word `bring',
always with the same reference (i.e. to Hesperus).

  The so-called `epiphoneme' might be defined as a phrase

adds ornament and beauty.

  Men are ashamed to say, to do or to intend to do shameful
things; cf. Sappho's reply when Alcaeus said:

  `I wish to say something to you, but shame prevents
me.' `... but if you had a desire for what is
honourable or good, and your tounge were not stirring
up something evil to say, shame would not cover
your eyes, but you would state your claim.'<fn 1>

<beg fn>
<fn 1>Aristotle implies a poem by Alc. with an answering poem by
S., and some edd. attach 1-2 to Alc. 384; but the anon.
scholiast is probably correct to attribute 1-2 like the rest to
S., i.e. to credit her with a poem in which she reported the
address and then answered it, and it is possible to take Aristotle's
words in this sense. Stephanus (11th or 12th c.) goes
further: he says S. is writing a dialogue, and he throws doubt
on the identity of both speakers. Perhaps S. wrote a poem
in which the identity of the male speaker was unclear, and
later biographers identified him falsely as Alc., noting that the
rhythm was Alcaic (no other certain example in S.): see test. 8

  Sappho's phrase, `more golden than gold', is certainly expressed
as a hyperbole and involves an impossibility, but it
does not fall flat: rather it derives charm from the impossibility.
Indeed one of the most amazing characteristics of the
divine Sappho is that she uses with charm a device that is of
itself hazardous and difficult.

  Rhodopis was Thracian by birth; along with Aesop she was
the slave of the Mytilenaean Iadmon; she was ransomed by
Charaxus, the brother of Sappho; Sappho calls her Doricha.

Appendix to the proverbs

  Rhodopis was a prostitute in the area of Naucratis in Egypt;
she is mentioned by both Sappho and Herodotus.

  The lovely Sappho often praises her brother Larichus<fn 1>

  After creating men Prometheus is said to have stolen fire and
revealed it to men. The gods were angered by this and sent
two evils on the earth, women and disease; such is the account

  Phaon's life revolved round his boat and the sea or, rather, a
strait. He met with no complaint from anyone, since he was a
fair man and accepted money only from those who were rich.
There was amazement among the Lesbians at his way of life.
The goddess, by whom they mean Aphrodite, approved of this
man, so she assumed the appearance of a mortal, an aged
woman, and spoke with Phaon about a crossing. He quickly
carried her over and asked for nothing. What did the goddess
do then? They say she transformed the old man and repaid
him with youth and beauty. This then is the Phaon about
her love for whom Sappho often sang in her lyric poetry.<fn 1>

<beg fn>

<WW>LIFE

<TY>1 Strabo, Geography

  Mytilene produced famous men: in olden times<fn 1>
Pittacus, one of the seven sages, and the poet Alcaeus<fn 2>
and his brother Antimenidas,<fn 3> who, says Alcaeus,
` while fighting as ally of the Babylonians<fn 4>
performed a great feat ...' (fr. 350). At the same
time as these flourished Sappho<fn 5> ... Because of
dissensions the city was ruled in those days by
various tyrants, and the so-called `stasiotic' poems<fn 6>
of Alcaeus were written about them. Pittacus was
one of the tyrants.<fn 7> Alcaeus abused him and the
rest alike, Myrsilus and Melanchrus and the Cleanactids<fn 8>
and others, although he himself was not innocent
of such revolutionary attempts.<fn 9> But Pittacus
used his `monarchy' for the overthrow of the powerful
factions, and when he had overthrown them he
restored the city's autonomy.

<beg fn>
<fn 1>For the chronology see Sa. test. 2 n. 3, test. 6 and Introd.
<fn 2>Cf. Ael. Aristid. Or. 12. 85; Himerius, Or. 27 says that A.
praises Lesbos and is always bringing Mytilene into his poems
(e.g. frr. 129, 130, 152). Richter, Portraits of the Greeks i 69
mentions a statue base from Pergamon inscribed<end eng> A)lkai=os
Mhtilhn[ai=os, <beg eng>`A. of Mytilene', and a 2nd c. A.D. coin, similarly
inscribed, with the head of Pittacus on the obverse.
<fn 3>Textual emendation at Plut. Mor. 155f provides another
reference to `the brother of A.' He also had a brother called
Cicis (fr. 414: cf. test. 2): J. Labarbe suggested that this
was also his father's name (Ant. Class. 37, 1968, 456-60).
<fn 4>Prob. in the campaign of Nebuchadrezzar against Ascalon
(cf. fr. 48); the city's fall is dated to 604 B.C. (Jerome D. Quinn,
BASO 164, 1961, 19-20).
<fn 5>Continued as Sa. test. 7.
<fn 6>Cf. Page, S. & A. 149-243.
<fn 7>From 590 to 580 (S. & A. 151).
<fn 8>Some editors delete `and' after Melanchrus:
schol. fr. 112. 23 explains `Cleanactidas' as `Myrsilus', but
there is no evidence that Melanchrus also belonged to this family.

<fn 1>Presumably Antimenidas and Cicis; fr. 75 also may indicate
that A. himself was too young to participate. Sud. II 1659
gives the date as Ol. 42 (612/608 B.C.), which is Pittacus'
floruit according to Diog. Laert. 1. 75.

<TY>3 Plutarch, On the Malice of Herodotus

  When the Athenians and Mytilenaeans were fighting
over Sigeum and the Athenian general Phrynon<fn 1>
challenged anyone who wished to single combat,
Pittacus stepped forward and trapping the man in a
net killed him though he was powerful and large ...
What then does Herodotus say at this point? Instead
of the heroic exploit of Pittacus, he describes
the flight of the poet Alcaeus from the battle and how
he threw away his armour.<fn 2> By passing over the
good and not omitting the shameful he lends support
to those who say that envy and delight in others'
misfortunes are products of a single vice.

<beg fn>
<fn 1>Alc. fr. 167. 17 mentions Phrynon. He was an Olympic
victor in 636/5 B.C. The fight with Pittacus occurred in
607/6 B.C. (Euseb. vers. arm. ii 90 Schne: cf. Page, S. & A.

plot against him (schol. 60a and 114) and escaped
to Pyrrha (schol. 114 calls this `the first exile'). Pittacus
had sworn to help A.'s party but joined forces with Myrsilus
(70. 7, 129), whose death pleased A. (332). Other allusions

the war was beginning between Alyattes and Astyages.<fn 5>

<beg fn>
<fn 1>Or `after'.
<fn 2>Or `deployment', acc. to Davison (op. cit.

`eclipse battle' of 585, which probably occurred at the river
Halys, boundary between Lydians and Medes; see also G.
Huxley, GRBS 6, 1965, 201-6. Alc. 448 mentions Thales,
who predicted the eclipse.
<fn 3>The form, which is Ionic, may
be a place-name, `Bridge' (W. G. Forrest ap. Huxley, op. cit. 205).
<fn 4>The argument is apparently intended to refute an
allegation that Antimenidas, brother of Alcaeus, died before
the second exile and `the action at the bridge'.
<fn 5>Eusebius records a war between Alyattes, king of Lydia, and
Astyages, king of Media, in Ol. 49. 3 = 582/1 (Armenian version
Ol. 49. 2 = 583/2). Huxley (op. cit. 204-6) reconciles
this dating with Hdt. 1. 74. The connection between the war
and Alcaeus' third return from exile is not clear. For other
dealings with the Lydians see fr. 69. The present text perhaps
goes on to refer to the Asopus and Tanagra, and it is possible
that fr. 82 of the papyrus, which mentions Boeotia, has to do

<TY>10 Inscription from Delos (after 166 B.C.)

  In the treasury of Andros<fn 1>:

wooden objects: ... a triangular roll-box<fn 2> containing
books of Alcaeus.

<beg fn>
<fn 1>The identification is made from Inscr. Dlos 1409 Ba II,
where the same objects are listed, including `books of Alcaeus'
(line 39).
<fn 2>This shape would suit ten rolls, and the tenth
is the highest-numbered book of Alcaeus quoted: see note at
fr. 307 and fr. 453 Voigt. Crusius suggested (R.E. s.v.
Alkaios, col. 1501) that Books 1-2 were hymns, 3-4 stasiotic,
5-6 erotic, 7-10 convivial. A papyrus text (P. Oxy. 2358 =

Book 4); for the length of books see frr. 120 n. 2, 143 n. 3 and

<TY><beg eng>11 Hephaestion, On Critical Signs

  In the lyric poets, if the poem is monostrophic, the
paragraph sign is put after each strophe, and the
`coronis' or curved flourish at the end of the poem
... The asterisk is usually employed if the next
poem is in a different metre, which happens in the
monostrophic poems of Sappho, Anacreon and Alcaeus. The
poems of Alcaeus are peculiar in this,
that in the edition of Aristophanes<fn 1> the asterisk was
used only to mark a change of metre, but in the now
current edition of Aristarchus<fn 2> it marks every fresh
poem.

  Masculine Sappho tempers the muse of Archilochus
by her choice of metre; so does Alcaeus, but
his themes and arrangement are different: he does
not look for a father-in-law to besmirch with his
black verses, nor does he tie a noose around the neck
of his fiance with his libellous verse.<fn 1> I, the lyric
poet of Latium, have brought Alcaeus to public

<WW>ANCIENT COMMENTATORS

<end fn>
<PN>225

<beg eng>older copies had this. It was Aristophanes<fn 2> who corrected
it to `Alcaeus' because the passage concerns
ancient poets and Achaeus was modern. Didymus<fn 3>
says in refutation of Aristophanes that Alcaeus cannot
be meant, since Alcaeus' poems, he declares, were
not fashionable because of their dialect. But this is
complete nonsense, for Alcaeus is parodied in the
Birds (see fr. 345) ... and in the Wasps (see fr.
141. 3) ... In another place Didymus says the
reading (`Alcaeus') can stand, but only if the reference
is to Alcaeus the lyre-player,<fn 4> not the lyric poet.

<WW><beg eng>THE VERDICT OF ANTIQUITY

<TY>19 Dionysius of Halicarnassus, On Literary Composition

  The third type of structure, which for want of an
appropriate and better name I call `mixed', is intermediate
to the other two; it has no individual character
but is, as it were, a moderate blend of the others
and a sort of selection from the best features of each
... As peak and high-point of all such writers ...
one would justly mention Homer. Every passage,
no matter where you take him up, has been elaborated
to perfection from the austere and the elegant
types. Of the others who used this intermediate
style ... among lyric poets Stesichorus and Alcaeus
deserve attention ...

<TY>20 Dionysius of Halicarnassus, On Imitation

  Observe Alcaeus' nobility, conciseness and sweetness
combined with forcefulness, and also his use of
figures and his clarity, in so far as it is not spoiled by
his dialect; and, above all, the tone of his political
poems. Often if you removed the metre you would
find political rhetoric.

<TY>21 Quintilian, Principles of Oratory

  Alcaeus is deservedly awarded a golden plectrum<fn 1>
in that part of his work in which he attacks the tyrants<fn 2>;
his contribution to morals here is also great;

Heraclitus, Homeric Allegories

  In plenty of passages we shall find the Mytilenean lyric poet
also using allegory: he equally (sc. with Archilochus: see
Archil. fr. 105 West) compares the upheavals caused by the
tyrants with stormy conditions at sea: `I fail to understand
... the anchors are slackening.' Who would not
immediately suppose from the opening seascape that this is
fear of the sea on the part of sailors? But that is not the case:
it is Myrsilus<fn 1> that is indicated and tyrannical conspiracy
being hatched against the Mytileneans.

<beg fn>

<beg eng>(b) `Plutarch', On Music

  For the pipe is not the invention of Marsyas or Olympus or
Hyagnis, as some suppose, taking only the lyre to be Apollo's
invention: the god invented the music of both pipe and lyre.
This is shown by the choral dances and sacrifices which they
used to present to the god to the accompaniment of pipes, as
is told by Alcaeus, among others, in one of his hymns.

(c) Himerius, Orations

  I wish to tell you a tale of Alcaeus, which he sang in lyric
verse when he wrote a paean to Apollo; and I shall tell it not
in the Lesbian verses, since I have nothing of the poet in me,
but changing the actual metre of the lyre into prose. When
Apollo was born, Zeus equipped him with golden headband
and lyre and gave him also a chariot of swans to drive, and sent
him to Delphi and the spring of Castalia, thence to declare
justice and right for the Greeks; but when Apollo mounted
the chariot he directed the swans to fly to the land of the
Hyperboreans. Now when the Delphians learned this, they
composed a paean and a tune and arranged dancing choirs of
youths around the tripod and called on the god to come from
the Hyperboreans. Apollo, however, delivered law among the
men of that region for a full year; but when he thought it was
time that the tripods of Delphi should ring out too, he ordered
his swans to fly back again from the Hyperboreans. Now it
was summer and indeed the very middle of summer when Alcaeus
brings Apollo back from the Hyperboreans: so what with
the blaze of summer and the presence of Apollo the poet's lyre
also adopts a summer wantonness in the account of the god:
nightingales sing for him the kind of song that one might
expect birds to sing in Alcaeus, swallows too and cicadas, not
proclaiming their own fortunes in the world but telling of the
god in all their songs. Castalia flows in poetic fashion with
waters of silver, and Cephisus<fn 1> rises in flood, surging with his
waves, in imitation of Homer's Enipeus<fn 2>: for Alcaeus is compelled
just like Homer to give even water the power to sense
the presence of gods.

<fn 2>See Od. 11. 238 ff.<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>357

<beg eng>(d) Strabo, Geography (on the Achaean Tritaea)

  There was in Phocis also a city of this name. So in Alcaeus
the Castalian spring at Delphi with its prophetic water is
called

<TX begin>water<fn 1> of Tritaea.<TX end>

<beg fn>
<fn 1>Or `joy of Tritaea': the noun is used especially of refreshing
liquid.
<end fn>

Pausanias, Description of Greece

  I have heard another version, that the water is a gift to
Castalia from the river Cephisus.<fn 1> Alcaeus said this in his
prelude to Apollo.

<beg fn>
<fn 1>A physical impossibility: similar nonsense, presumably
local superstitition, in schol. Pind. Pae. 6. 7 (P. Oxy. 841) and
the tale of the Lilaean cakes in Paus. loc. cit. Dion. Call. 73
and Eust. Il. 275. 19, who speak of another Cephisus in
Phocis, may depend ultimately on Alcaeus.

  But since this type of hymn (viz. genealogical) is found
among the ancients, and some have sung of the birth of
Dionysus, others of the birth of Apollo, Alcaeus of the birth of
Hephaestus and also of the birth of Hermes, I have made this
a separate class... The type is useful in itself to the poet
but never to the prose-writer; for the poet deals with the midwifery
of the Graces and the nursing of the Seasons<fn 1> and suchlike,
while the prose-writer must of necessity speak as briefly
as possible.

  ... the lines used by dice-players: a central line was called

the proverb, `to move from the holy line', used of people in
despair needing to turn to their last resource. Sophron uses
it in the passage, `Now I shall move from the holy line',
omitting the word `piece' or `stone'. Alcaeus gives the
saying in full:

<TY>428(a) Strabo, Geography (on Sigeum)

  Pittacus of Mytilene ... sailed against Phrynon, the

with bad organisation and no success. It was at this time that
the poet Alcaeus says he was hard pressed in some engagement
and threw away his arms and fled: he addresses a herald, telling
him to make this announcement to the people at home:

  Alcaeus is safe, but the Athenians hung up (his
armour? the shield that was his protection?) in the
holy temple of Grey-eyed Athena<fn 1>

(b) Herodotus, Histories<fn 1>

  The Mytileneans and Athenians, based respectively on the
town of Achilleum and on Sigeum, were at war. One of the
more remarkable incidents in the fighting was the action in
which the poet Alcaeus, when the Athenians were winning,
took to his heels and escaped, though his arms were seized by
the Athenians, who hung them up in the temple of Athena at
Sigeum. Alcaeus composed a poem about this and sent it to
Mytilene to tell his adventure to a friend, Melanippus.<fn 2>
