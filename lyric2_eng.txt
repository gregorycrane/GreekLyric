<WW>BIOGRAPHY

<TY>1 Suda

  Anacreon: a lyric poet of Teos, the son of Scythinus
or, according to other authorities, of Eumelus,
Parthenius or Aristocritus.<fn 1> He wrote elegiac and
iambic poems, all in the Ionic dialect. He lived in
the time of Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos, in Olympiad
52 (572/1-569/8 B.C.).<fn 2> But other authorities put
him in Olympiad 55 (560/59-557/6 B.C.) at the time
of Cyrus<fn 3> and Cambyses.<fn 4> Because of the revolt of

<beg fn>
<fn 1>Son of Scythinus or Parthenius, acc. to schol. Pl. Phdr.
235c; cf. elegiacs in schol. Pind. i 10 Drachm., J. Labarbe
Ant. Class. 37, 1968, 461-6. Richer, Portraits of the Greeks
i 77 records a herm (I.G. xiv 1133) inscribed<end eng> A)nak ... Sku
... Thi ... , <beg eng>prob. `A., son of Scythinus, of Teos'. For the
5th or 4th c. iambic poet Scythinus of Teos see Edmonds,
Elegy and Iambus ii 244 ff.
<fn 2>Some scholars emend the
date to Ol. 62 (532/1-529/8), the traditional date of
Polycrates' acme (cf. test. 2). But there were probably two
tyrants of this name, the father ruling c. 572-540, the son
(the Polycrates of Herodotus) ruling 533-522. A.'s
contemporary would be the son. Ol. 52 may have seen both
the accession of Polycrates I and the births of A. and P. II
(J.P. Barron, CQ 14, 1964, 210-29: see also fr. 491).
<fn 3>Cf. Zenobius 5.80 (see fr. 426); Cyrus began his reign in Ol. 55
(Eusebius).
<fn 4>`At the time of Cyrus and Polycrates',
according to Athen. 13. 599c (=Sa. test. 8); cf. Aristox. fr. 12
Wehrli: `Cambyses was contemporary with the tyranny of
Polycrates.' Since Ol. 55 does not fit Cyrus' son Cambyses
III, some scholars emend to Ol. 62, the date when Cambyses
succeeded Cyrus (e.g. Rohde, Rh. Mus. 33, 1878, 190).
Others read `Cyrus the son of Cambyses (II)': see J.
Labarbe, Ant. Class. 31, 1962, 184.<end eng>
<end fn>
<PN>25

<beg eng>Histiaeus he had to leave Teos and settled in Abdera
in Thrace.<fn 5> His life was devoted to the love of boys
and women and to song. He composed drinking
songs and iambics and the so-called Anacreontea.<fn 6>

<beg fn>
<fn 5>Cf. Sud. T 319, Strab. 14. 1. 30 = fr. 505(a). Histiaeus,
tyrant of Miletus involved in the Ionian revolt (see Hdt.
5.35-6; 6.1), is probably confused by Suda with Harpagus,
for whom see test.3.

  It is recorded that approximately 514 years
elapsed between the Trojan War and the time of
Xenophanes the physicist,<fn 1> Anacreon, Polycrates,
the blockade and destruction of Ionia by Harpagus
the Mede<fn 2> and the migration of the Phocaeans to
Marseilles to escape it. For Pythagoras was contemporary
with all these.

<TY>4 Aelian, Historical Miscellanies<fn 2>

  Polycrates of Samos loved the arts, and he
honoured and favoured Anacreon of Teos, delighted
with both the man and his poetry.<fn 3> But I do not
praise his luxury.<fn 4>

  This refers to Alcaeus and Ibycus and Anacreon
and anyone else before Pindar who may have devoted
his attention to his favourite boy: for these
writers were older than Pindar. They say that when
Anacreon was asked why he did not write hymns to
gods but to boys, he replied, `Because they are my
gods.'

  Anacreon the lyric poet lived eighty-five
years<fn 1>..

(=Anacr. 412) he lived long enough to enjoy the works of
Aeschylus, whose first plays were performed c. 499-6 (first
victory 484).

<TY>10 Pausanias, Description of Greece

  On the Athenian acropolis there are statues of
Pericles and his father Xanthippus, who fought the
Persians in the naval engagement off Mycale.<fn 1> But
Pericles' statue is on one side, while near Xanthippus
stands Anacreon of Teos, the first poet after
Sappho of Lesbos to make love his main theme. The
statue represents him as a man singing when he is
drunk.<fn 2>

<fn 2>The statue in the Carlsberg
Glyptothek in Copenhagen is probably not a copy of the

<WW>THE VERDICT OF ANTIQUITY<fn 1>

<TY>16 Hermogenes, Kinds of Style (on simplicity)

  In general, thoughts which are pure are thoughts
of simplicity... More particularly, one would call
`simple' the thoughts of unaffected and to some
extent childlike, not to say stupid, natures. For
example, it is `simple' to go over events and recount
them when there is no necessity and no-one is asking
a question. Most of Anacreon is like this...

<TY><beg eng>18 Athenaeus, Scholars at Dinner

  Anacreon, who made all his poetry depend on the
subject of intoxication,<fn 1> is unusual. For he is attacked
as having given himself over in his poetry to
laxity and luxury, since most people are unaware
that he was sober while he composed and that he was
an upright man,<fn 2> who merely pretended to be drunk,
though there was no necessity for his doing so.

come up, tell us, Ulpian, what `the garland of Naucratis' is
in the charming Anacreon; for the sweet poet says (fr. 434);
and why in the same poet are some people garlanded with
willow? In Book 2 of his songs he says:

  The kindly Megistes has for ten months now garlanded
himself with willow and drunk the honeysweet
must.<fn 1>

The garland of willow is absurd, since willow is suitable for
ropes and wicker-work. So tell us something about these
things, since they deserve investigation...' Democritus

  But in Anacreon the mixture is one part wine to two

  Come, boy, bring me a bowl, so that I may drink
without stopping for breath; pour in ten ladles of
water and five of wine, that I may once again play
the Bacchant with decorum;

Scythian drinking:

  It follows that the king should not offer prayers like

  Chamaeleon in his treatise On Sappho actually declares

  The figure polyptoton (repetition of a word in different

  I love Cleobulus, I am mad about Cleobulus, I gaze
at Cleobulus.<end eng>

  And Sappho says to the man who is extravagantly

  One might well believe that it was from their great

  It is remarkable that the tyrant Polycrates is nowhere
recorded as having summoned either women or boys to
his court, although he was passionately devoted to the
company of males, to the extent of being a rival of the poet
Anacreon at the time when in anger he cut off the hair of
his beloved boy.

Aelian, Historical Miscellanies<fn 1>

  Anacreon praised Smerdies, the favourite of Polycrates,
too warmly, and the youth enjoyed the praise ...; but
Polycrates was jealous that Anacreon had honoured
Smerdies, and seeing that the youth returned the poet's
love he cut off the boy's hair to disgrace him and cause
Anacreon grief. But Anacreon, showing good sense and
self-control, did not presume to blame Polycrates but
rather turned his reproach on the boy in the words which
upbraided his rashness and folly in taking arms against his
own hair. Let Anacreon sing the song on what happened to
the hair: he will sing it better than I.

  In the beginning the libation was given to the gods as

<TY>505 Fragments of uncertain authorship ascribed by some
to Anacreon

(a) Strabo, Geography

  Teos is situated on a peninsula, and it has a harbour. It is
the birthplace of Anacreon, the lyric poet, in whose day the
Teians abandoned their city and moved to Abdera in
Thrace, since they would not tolerate the insolence of the
Persians; whence these words:

<TX begin>Abdera, fair colony of the Teians.<TX end>

(b) Strabo, Geography (on Samos)

  Syloson was left a private citizen by his brother
(Polycrates); but he presented Darius with a robe which he
coveted when he saw him wearing it, and so Darius, when
he eventually became king, gave Syloson the tyranny in
return. His rule was so harsh that Samos became short of
men. This was the origin of the saying,

<TX begin>thanks to Syloson there is plenty of room.<TX end>

(c) = `Sappho or Alcaeus' fr. 1<end eng>
<PN>145

<beg eng>(d) Clement of Alexandria, Miscellanies

  For when Anacreon<fn 1> had written,

  For I am eager to sing of tender Love, his head
garlanded with luxuriant flowers: he is the ruler
over gods, he is the subduer of mortals,
Euripides wrote, `For Love assails not men alone.'

<beg fn>
<fn 1>The lines almost certainly belong to the Anacreontea.
<end fn>

Fulgentius, Mythologies

  According to Anacreon,<fn 1> a most ancient author, when
Zeus was beginning warfare against the Titans, i.e. the
sons of Titan, brother of Cronus, and had sacrificed to
Heaven, he saw an eagle fly nearby as a favourable omen
for victory. In return for this happy omen, and particularly
because it was indeed followed by victory, he put a golden
eagle on his war standards and dedicated it as a protection
for his valour; from these are derived the Roman standards
of this type.

<fn 1>Probably a later Anacreon: see R.E. Suppl. 1 p. 76 (Anakreon
1a).

Meleager included in his Garland epigrams attributed to
Anacreon (test. 17), and eighteen carry his name in the
Palatine Anthology. Some may be authentic, e.g. 100, 107,
108, but certainty is impossible: the author's name was not
added to epitaphs or dedications before the end of the 5th c.
B.C., and there is seldom any corroborative evidence about
the authorship. Some are demonstrably later than Anacreon,
e.g. 114, 115, `Simon. 156D.' and probably 105; the manner of
102 and the content of 113 point to Hellenistic authorship.

  ...I shall now pass to music for the pipes. The

Apollo, the so-called Many-headed nome. This
Olympus, they say, was one of the descendants of the
first Olympus,<fn 1> Marsyas' pupil, who had composed
his nomes in honour of the gods: this Olympus, who
was the favourite of Marsyas and learned his piping
from him, introduced to Greece the enharmonic<fn 2>
nomes which the Greeks now use in their festivals

<TY>5 `Plutarch', On Music

  Olympus, as Aristoxenus<fn 1> says, is supposed by
musical authorities to have been the discoverer of
the enharmonic genus,<fn 2> everything before him having
been diatonic or chromatic. They suspect that
his discovery happened as follows: Olympus was
working in the diatonic and often making his melody
move to the diatonic parhypate (F), sometimes from
the paramese (b), sometimes from the mese (a), bypassing
the diatonic lichanos (G); and so he realised
the beauty of the melody's character, and came in
this way to admire and adopt the system founded on
its analogy, composing with these intervals in the
Dorian mode ....

  These then were the first enharmonic compositions;
later the semitone (F-E) was divided in both
the Lydian and the Phrygian modes. Clearly

<TY>7 `Plutarch', On Music

  Similarly it was not because they did not know all
the modes that they used only some of them: it was
not ignorance that caused their narrow range and
their use of few notes or that made Olympus and
Terpander and those who followed their chosen
practice avoid the use of many notes and complexity.
The compositions of Olympus and Terpander and all
kindred spirits are the proof: they use three notes<fn 1>
and are simple, but they are superior to compositions
that are complex and use many notes, so that
no one can copy Olympus' style, and those who use
many notes and a variety of scales fall short of him.

<TY>8 `Plutarch', On Music

  Again, the famous Olympus, who is credited with
the foundation of Greek and nomic music, is said to<end eng>
<PN>281

<beg eng>have invented the enharmonic genus<fn 1> and among
rhythms the prosodiac,<fn 2> in which the nome of Ares is
composed, and the choree,<fn 3> of which he made much

<TY>9 `Plutarch', On Music

  This (sc. the moral character of a piece of music),
we say, is brought about by a combination or a blend
of elements or by both. Take for example Olympus'
setting of the enharmonic genus in the Phrygian
mode and his blending of it with the paeon epibatos<fn 1>:
this is what created the moral character of
the opening of the nome of Athena. For when you
add the handling of the melody and rhythm and
skilfully change the rhythm by itself so that it
becomes trochaic instead of paeonic, then you have
the enharmonic genus of Olympus. Moreover, if you
keep the enharmonic genus and the Phrygian mode
and the whole tetrachord system as well, the moral
character can be much altered: for the so-called
`harmony' in the nome of Athena is very different in
character from the introduction.

Processional Hymn to Delos:

to send for the Lesbian singer; so sending for Terpander,
who was in exile from Antissa<fn 2> because of a

<TY>17 Plutarch, Spartan Customs

  If anyone tried to break the rules of the old music
in any way, they (sc. the Spartans) would not allow
it. Even Terpander, one of the older musicians, the
best cithara-singer of his day and a praiser of the
deeds of the heroes, was none the less fined by the
ephors, who took his lyre and nailed it to a wall, all
because he fitted one extra string to give variety of
sound: only the simpler type of melody met with
their approval.<end eng>

  So, according to him (sc. Heraclides<fn 1>), Terpander,
a composer of nomes for cithara-singing, set to music
in each nome his own hexameters<fn 2> and Homer's and
sang them in the contests; and he says that Terpander
was the first to supply names<fn 3> for the nomes of

  The nomes sung to the cithara were established in

Aeolian, Trochaios (`trochaic') and Oxys (`highpitched'),
Cepion<fn 1> and Terpandrean, and also Tetraoidios

  Something must be said also about rhythms, for
new genera and species of rhythm were invented,
and indeed of melodic and rhythmic composition.
First of all, the originality of Terpander introduced a
noble style into music<fn 1>; while Polymnestus, after
the introduction of this Terpandrean style, used a
new one, although he too kept to the noble manner,
as did Thaletas and Sacadas, who were innovators at
least in rhythmic composition, but did not depart
from the noble style.

  Lycurgus through favour and friendship persuaded
one of the Cretans who had a high reputation

songs for the lyre and used this art as a screen, but in

Hyacinthia,<fn 2> `I heard the nightingales, which by (the
waters) of the Eurotas ... the Amyclaean ... best-governed
...' ... `excellence ...' somewhere in

not (surprising) that despite his Lydian origin Spartans
at that date put him in charge of the traditional
choruses of their daughters and young men ... but
did not yet (allow foreigners?) to compete, (since)
even now they still use foreigners to train their
choruses. For if the Spartans had made him a citizen
because of his poetic skill, it is (strange) that Alcman
should diffame himself in his songs and say that
he was a barbarian and a Lydian on account of his
(Lydian?) country and (race)...

<beg fn>
<fn 5>It seems that the historian of Lydia (Xanthus?) made no

... Polydeuces<fn 2>: I do not reckon Lycaethus<fn 3>
among the dead but Enarsphorus and swift-footed
Sebrus and ... the violent<fn 4> and ... the helmeted
and Euteiches and lord Areius and ... outstanding
among demigods;

<beg fn>
<fn 1>Found at Saqqra in 1855, first published by Egger in
1863. Grammarians and others refer to various lines of the
poem, ascribing them to Alcman: the scholiast on Pindar
and Herodian and others give garbled versions of vv. 2 and
6; Hesychius reports that Alcman gave the name Porcus to
Nereus, the sea-god (see v. 19); others discuss the words<end eng>
u(popetridi/wn <beg eng>(49),<end eng> fa/ros <beg eng>(61)<end eng>, a)mu/nasqai <beg eng>(cf. 65)<end eng>, sieidh/s <beg eng>(71).
<fn 2>Perhaps 35 lines are missing from the beginning of the
poem. A. lists the dead sons of Hippocoon, mythical king of
Sparta, who had exiled his younger brother Tyndareus,
father of Castor and Polydeuces; he was attacked by
Heracles, apparently in collaboration with Tyndareus and
his sons, and was killed together with his sons, of whom A.
names ten; Heracles established Tyndareus as king,
instructing him to hold the kingship in his family until the
return of the Heraclidae. Heracles is not mentioned in the
extant lines; but when Clement of Alexandria quotes
Sosibius to the effect that Heracles was wounded by the
sons of Hippocoon, the scholiast reports, `Alcman mentions
it in Book 1.' According to the same scholiast, Euphorion
in his Thrax made the sons of Hippocoon `rival suitors' of
Castor and Polydeuces: this may be relevant to
v. 16 ff.
<fn 3>A distant cousin of the sons of Hippocoon: see scholia A.

<beg eng>and great ..., gatherer (of the army), and Eurytus
in the hurly-burly (of blind Ares?) and Alcon, finest
warriors, we shall by no means pass over: Fate and
Poros,<fn 5> those ancient ones, conquered them all, and
their valour which was without foundation<fn 6> collapsed.
Let no man fly to heaven or attempt to marry
Aphrodite, the (Cyprian) queen, nor some ... nor a
daughter of Porcus<fn 7> (of the sea) ...; it is the
Graces<fn 8> with love in their eyes who (frequent?) the
house of Zeus; ... god ... to friends ... gave gifts
... youth lost ... throne<fn 9> ... vain ... went; one
of them (died)<fn 10> by an arrow, (another) by a marble

suffered, since they plotted evil.

  And so I sing of the brightness of Agido: I see her
like the sun, which Agido summons to shine on us as
our witness; but our illustrious choir-leader<fn 12> by no
means allows me either to praise or to fault her<fn 13>;
for she herself seems pre-eminent, just as if one were
to put a horse among grazing herds, a sturdy,
thunderous-hoofed prize-winner, one of those seen in
rock-sheltered dreams. Why, don't you see? The
race-horse is Venetic<fn 14>; but the hair of my cousin
Hagesichora has the bloom of undefiled gold, and
her silver face -- why do I tell you openly? This is
Hagesichora here; and the second in beauty after
Agido will run like a Colaxaean horse against an
Ibenian<fn 15>; for the Pleiads,<fn 16> as we carry a plough<fn 17>

<beg fn>
<fn 11>Or `cheerfully'.
<fn 12>Presumably Hagesichora, whose
name means Choir-leader; so at 84. Agido seems to be
her principal assistant in the rites.
<fn 13>I.e. Agido.
<fn 14>From the northern Adriatic (mod. Venice); the race-horse must be Agido.
<fn 15>I.e. Agido has no close rival:
the Colaxaean horse may be from Scythia (see Bolton,
Aristeas 43), the swifter Ibenian from Lydia.
<fn 16>Subject of much controversy: probably the Pleiads (or Doves) are
a rival choir, and the imagery of fighting (63), protection
(65), guarding (77) and peace (91) refers to their competition.
Others take the Pleiads to be the star-group,
hurrying the singers at the approach of dawn or of the
ploughing-season. Others again follow the Scholiast and
take the Pleiads (or doves) to be Hagesichora and Agido;
in their view the military imagery is erotic.

  For abundance of purple is not sufficient for protection,

headband, pride of dark-eyed girls, nor the hair of
Nanno, nor again godlike Areta nor Thylacis and

and say, `If only Astaphis were mine, if only Philylla
were to look my way and Damareta and lovely
Ianthemis'; no, Hagesichora guards me.<fn 21> For is not
fair-ankled Hagesichora present here? Does she not
remain (near) Agido and commend our festival?
Come, you gods, accept their (prayers): to the gods
belong fulfilment and accomplishment. Choir-leader, -- if
I may speak -- I am myself only a girl

Hagesichora that girls trod the path of lovely
peace.<fn 24>

  For (like) the trace-horse<fn 25> ..., and in a ship too
one must obey the helmsman most of all; and she is of
course (not) more melodious than the Sirens, for they
are goddesses; but this our choir of ten sings as well

<fn 22>Presumably `Dawn-goddess' and to be equated with
Orthria (61), but not securely identified: suggestions are
Artemis, Helen, Phoebe (for whom see fr. 8).
<fn 23>Not understood: perhaps a metaphorical reference to the
arduous preparations for a previous festival and
competition, rather than to a disaster such as sickness or
war.
<fn 24>Perhaps victory in a competition, but see n. 16.
<fn 25>Presumably Hagesichora guides the choir as
the trace-horse and helmsman direct chariot and ship.

Derites' other sons, whom he does not mention by name.<fn 2>

<beg fn>
<fn 1>The word<end eng> o(/ti, <beg eng>used to introduce some of the scholia,

<fn 2>Derites was a cousin of Oebalus, father of Tyndareus and Hippocoon (Paus. 7.18.5).
<end fn>

  v. 6 Pherecydes makes Areitus one of Hippocoon's sons,
so perhaps here also it should be written with the letter t;
either that or Alcman called Areitus Areius.

  v. 14 he has identified Poros with the god called Chaos by
Hesiod in his mythologising [Theog. 116, 123].

  v. 49 The poets are accustomed to ascribe and compare to
dreams things that are wonderful and prodigious, since that
is how they appear in the dream. He has called dreams `rock-sheltered'

copying Homer: cf. Odyssey [24.11f.],<fn 1> `and they went past
the streams of Ocean and the White Rock, past the gates of

  The Alcmanic figure is the one which inserts plural or

  ... of all ... (Thetis?).

  After that, ancient Poros and Tekmor<fn 11>: Tekmor
came into being after Poros ... thereupon ... (called
him) Poros since (the beginning `provided' all things?); for
when the matter<fn 12> began to be set in order, a certain Poros
came into being as a beginning. So Alcman (represents) the
matter of all things as confused and unformed. Then he
says that one came into being who set all things in order,
then that Poros came into being, and that when Poros had
passed by Tekmor followed. And Poros is as a beginning,
Tekmor like an end. When Thetis<fn 13> had come into being, a
beginning and end of all things came into being
(simultaneously), and all things<fn 14> have their nature
resembling the matter of bronze, while Thetis has hers
resembling that of the craftsman, Poros and Tekmor
resembling the beginning and the end. He uses the word
`ancient'<end eng> [1pre/sgus]1 <beg eng>for `old'.

  And the third, darkness: since neither sun nor moon
had come into being yet, but matter was still
undifferentiated. So (at the same moment?) there came into
being Poros and Tekmor and darkness.<fn 15>

<beg fn>
<fn 11>See J. L. Penwill, Apeiron 8 (1974) 13 ff.: Poros,
the Contriver at 1.14, may here be rather the `Passage'
created between Heaven and Earth; Tekmor is probably
`Ordinance'.
<fn 12>The commentator uses an Aristotelian
term in his explanation: so with `beginning' and `end'.
<fn 13>Not the sea-goddess, but `Creation' (=Attic<end eng> qe/sis: <beg eng>cf.
20. 1<end eng> e)/shke, <beg eng>probably from this poem).
<fn 14>By `all things'
he means the<end eng> u(/lh, <beg eng>`matter'.

which follows.<end eng>

perhaps, he says, it is made up of<end eng> xai=on, <beg eng>`a cowman's stick',

ambiguous, as is evident in Alcman at the beginning of

  he was no rustic man nor clumsy (not even in the
view of unskilled men?) nor Thessalian by race nor
an Erysichaean shepherd: he was from lofty Sardis.<fn 1>

<TY>38 Apollonius Dyscolus, Pronouns

  The form<end eng> a(mw=n <beg eng>in Doric signifies a possessive genitive (`of

  These words and melody Alcman invented by observing
